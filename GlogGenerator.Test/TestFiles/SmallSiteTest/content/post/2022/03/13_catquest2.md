Like the first <game:Cat Quest>, <game:Cat Quest II> is, well, not exactly a genre-redefining masterpiece.  (Unless that genre is <i>cat puns</i>.)  It's a competent, adorable, and straightforward action RPG; with experience points and gold pieces, upgrade-able weapons and armor, and a whole lot of "go here" or "kill that" quests serving an unremarkable narrative.

A headline for this sequel is: <b>co-op</b>!  Two players can do those quests, buy those upgrades, and bludgeon enemies to death <i>together</i>.  The simple formula allows partners of any skill level to collaborate on this pun-filled adventure through the Felingard and Lupus kingdoms.

Sub-headline: you can still play solo, with an AI-controlled buddy, which works well enough.

Player ability - or AI ability - rarely factors into the experience.  ... including late-game moments when it gets "hard," at least since a <a href="https://thegentlebros.com/cat-quest-2-mew-world/">difficulty update</a> that's made some later enemies and bosses very insta-death-ey.  These encounters are more frustratingly stat-based than they are challenging or strategic: either you have enough HP and strength to out-survive the enemy, or, you don't.

So it's disappointing that some tedious level-grinding is required to get strong enough for the game's final caves.

Otherwise, Cat Quest II is a simple and fun button-mashy romp, and dressing up your kitten (and now, a puppy!) in little warrior outfits is just too damn cute.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Biped>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: the first <game:Cat Quest>, in terms of difficulty pace.  (If only that was co-op!)  
<b>The ending implies there <i>will</i> be a Cat Quest III</b>: and, hey, why not?  I'm in for it.

<i>Progress: Level 180, completed all dungeons and found all equipment.</i>
