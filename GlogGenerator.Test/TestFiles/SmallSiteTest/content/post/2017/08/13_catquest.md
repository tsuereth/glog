{{% game "Cat Quest" %}}Cat Quest{{% /game %}} is shallow, but adorable.

The action RPG is pretty simple: no skill trees, limited combat abilities, straightforward plot; and it's designed to be playable on a smartphone.  It's not complicated or crazy enough to hold my interest.

Which is sort of a shame, because it's a perfectly functional game, and the cat motif is really damn cute.  Map areas are named "The Catpital" and "Mewtown."  You save the game and restore health by taking a Cat Nap.  You can find and equip clothing like hats, and put a hat on the cat and it's just so <i>aww</i>.

I'll definitely be recommending this to others, and hell, I just might pick up an {{% platform "Android" %}}Android{{% /platform %}} version when that comes out.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
