<game:Cat Quest> finally came out on Android, and now my phone's battery is dead.

Despite how proud I am of this post's title, mobile isn't a "perfect" fit for Cat Quest's combat: avoiding attacks (by moving away from them) is harder than with a mouse or controller, and so combat is more spammy and chaotic than when I [played on PC]($SiteBaseURL$2017/08/13/an-rpg-for-kittens/).

But given the simple nature of the game, having it in my pocket is pretty ideal.  I can play it while I'm waiting for important things to happen.

(With the aforementioned deleterious effect to my phone battery.)

What's impressed me most is that Cat Quest is signposting a lot more content than I expected.  The map is surprisingly big!  There are a ton more equipment types than I though there'd be.  I walked by a dungeon that says I should be <b>level 40</b>.

Neat.

<i>Progress: Level 18</i>
