<game:Ara: History Untold> isn't a bad <tag:Civilization> clone.

It's not an alternate perspective of the genre, like <game:Massive Chalice>.  It doesn't re-theme the Civ formula like <tag:Warlock> or <tag:Age of Wonders>, or even twist it like [Beyond Earth](game:Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth).  This is *Kirkland Signature Sid Meier's*.

Military management is a little underwhelming, compared to building infrastructure and expanding your empire -- just like [Civ V](game:Sid Meier's Civilization V).  The nuances of city micromanagement are fiddly and confusing -- just like Civ V.  Diplomacy is mercurial, leaders rejecting simple trade proposals for no apparent reason -- just like Civ V.

And once you've got a campaign started, it's **hard to put down**; there's an addictive urge to play "just one more turn" -- just like Civ V.

I do think that it needs a better interface for late-game management of your over-long checklist of city details (or maybe ... fewer details to manage in the first place), so it's cool to see [post-launch support](https://www.arahistoryuntold.com/version-1-1-the-invisible-hand-update/) like the National Economy Screen making progress in that direction.

All that said, I don't know if I've got it in me to sink more evenings and weekends into the same kind of 4X empire-building I've clicked through before.

*But*, I am a big fan of the online multiplayer as a "light" social experience.  It's easy to process the game's prompts-to-action while shooting the breeze in voice chat (and talking shit about Queen Elizabeth).
