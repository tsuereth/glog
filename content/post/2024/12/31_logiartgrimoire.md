<game:Logiart Grimoire> is a solid nonogram game -- as should be expected, given [Jupiter](tag:Jupiter Corporation)'s pedigree.  It's *loaded* with puzzles, 280 just in the main mode!, including some pretty damn big grids, up to 40x30 at their biggest.

But... it's *just* puzzles.

I'd hoped for more from the game's "story," that its magical mystery tome would set up a narrative adventure like <game:Murder by Numbers>, or at least some entertaining characters like <game:Khimera: Puzzle Island>.  Instead, the titular grimoire is simply a thematic backdrop, and your magic assistant Emil occasionally throws in some trite flavor text.

There's also a "fusion" mechanic which uses riddle-like prompts to unlock new puzzles - like, *"**Water droplets** are dripping steadily from **above**"* is a prompt to select (previously-solved puzzles) Water and Wind to unlock a puzzle for Rain - but these riddles feel more like a chore than a challenge.

I kinda wish that Logiart Grimoire had more mechanical accommodations for its biggest puzzles; without a zoomed view, like <game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter> or <game:Pictopix>, navigating huge grids is pretty fiddly and accident-prone.

But while a minimal story and scale-limiting mechanics keep Logiart Grimoire from being a *great*, nonogram game, it's nevertheless a solid genre entry, with enough content to occupy an addict like me for 70+ hours of scanning and clicking.

**Better than**: <game:Picross e>, <game:Puppy Cross>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Piczle Cross Adventure>, <game:Voxelgram>  
**Better (albeit blander) than**: <game:PictoQuest: The Cursed Grids>
