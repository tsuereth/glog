Concluding the [Dominus Collection](game:Castlevania Dominus Collection), [Order of Ecclesia](game:Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (2024)) thankfully brings back collectible enemy souls - as "glyphs" - and ups the sidequest ante with a village's worth of NPCs to run errands for.

But it's surprisingly hard, especially in terms of survivability; and the fragmented world map is...

Oh you know what?  Unlike [Portrait of Ruin](game:Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin (2024)), my opinions on Ecclesia haven't changed since I played [the original](game:Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia).  And I love lazily quoting [my own previous posts]($SiteBaseURL$2009/07/19/castlevania-order-of-ecclesia-6/).

Seriously, look at these trivially tiny map areas:

![]($SiteBaseURL$castlevania-order-of-ecclesia_lighthouse.jpg){width=960 height=540}

Portrait of Ruin's sub-maps were, I assume, an attempt to build more geography than could fit in one screen-sized map.  But all the miniscule maps that Ecclesia carves out, some for insignificant locations (like that pointless forest), just feel like boring filler in the way of the castle I *really* want to explore.

Well, at least this game (especially its NPC village) was a clear learning opportunity for IGA on his way to [Bloodstained](game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night).

*Progress: gave up after the Lighthouse.*
