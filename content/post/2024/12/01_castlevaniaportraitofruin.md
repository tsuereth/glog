I *really* liked <game:Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin>, back [in 2006]($SiteBaseURL$2006/12/08/castlevania-portrait-of-ruin-3/).  But its [Dominus Collection](game:Castlevania Dominus Collection) remaster doesn't have the same impact today.

Portrait of Ruin's got a lot of content, in terms of geography and running length; this castle and its portraits' sub-maps include plenty of ground to cover.  The disconnected-ness of those sub-maps, though, highlights how linear the game really is: a section of the castle is followed by a portrait, then another section of castle, then another portrait, then another section of castle...

An interconnected Metroidvania map can give players a feeling of freedom, of self-directed agency, when it lets you get lost in one of multiple branching routes; it can at least give the *illusion* of agency when it teases out-of-reach paths for you to revisit with later abilities.  But the straight-line path through Portrait of Ruin's world has so little freedom, and so few of those future-ability teases, that the map hardly feels interconnected at all.

Portrait of Ruin also eschews [Soma](game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow) [Cruz](game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow)'s soul-collection mechanic, playing more like his games' character-swapping "Julius Mode" -- one character (Jonathan) handles whips and swords and hammers, another (Charlotte) can summon fire and lightning and ice shards.  Which works, but isn't quite as exciting as mixing-and-matching your own wacky combination of soul abilities.

What's "cool," or at least *was* cool a couple decades ago, is that while controlling one character you can let the game fight automatically as the other.  The benefits of that computer-controlled partnership are very limited though: they don't position themselves very well, and they become incapacitated fairly easily.  Outside of combat they're in the way more often than they're helpful; a "jump on your partner's shoulders" move is pretty sweet, but there aren't any other team-up mobility moves like it.

And although Portrait of Ruin's equipment-collection grind is comparable to Soma's souls, it doesn't feel as satisfying because... item drops and skill-point counters aren't all that related to the monsters you're killing.  Or to put it another way, in the *Sorrow* games each monster felt like an opportunity to get some specific power, while Portrait of Ruin's monsters feel like meaningless fodder.

Portrait of Ruin is a perfectly serviceable hack-and-slash action RPG, and there's an impressive amount of stuff to do in it.  But the quality of that stuff is a bit lacking; the map isn't interesting to explore, your ability customization options are limited, and without monster-specific souls to collect, the enemies all kind-of blend together.

[Aria](game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (2021)) and [Dawn of Sorrow](game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow (2024)) held up surprisingly well in their remakes, but revisiting this game has unfortunately spoiled my fond memories of it.

*Progress: gave up in the Sandy Grave.*
