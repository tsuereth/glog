Calling the two newest <tag:Uncharted> games a "[Legacy Collection](game:Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection)" feels a bit strange; then again, [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End) *is* eight years old, now.  (Oof.)

It's not too surprising that Uncharted 4 holds up great -- it was [a "shining jewel in the franchise" at launch]($SiteBaseURL$2016/05/23/charting-complete/), and not many *Indiana Jones*-styled adventure games have bothered trying to unseat it since.

(The PC implementation is just fine, although I did crash once or twice over its dozen-plus hours, and some complex scenes - like the jungley and oceany and rainy islands - had pretty inconsistent framerates.)

And [Lost Legacy](game:Uncharted: The Lost Legacy), despite being a smaller outing with a less-epic story, has held up great as well.  Sure, it still left me wanting more free-roaming activities, and wanting more narrative stakes for its characters; but Chloe and Nadine's adventure is satisfying enough on its own.

Of course, I continue playing these games on the "Explorer" - easiest - difficulty, because I'm so incredibly uninterested in dying and retrying a gunfight with [wave after wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF3g4Ua5e7k) of disposable goons.  But I appreciate that there *are* gunfights, and not just instant-fail pure-stealth sneak sequences, even if that's more what a "real" archaeologist might do.

More than anything, replaying these games (especially Uncharted 4's nostalgia-heavy intro) makes me yearn for remakes of Drake's [El Dorado](game:Uncharted: Drake's Fortune), [Shambhala](game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves), and [Iram](game:Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception) adventures.  But those *legacy* entries are likely in need of thorough redevelopment, by now.
