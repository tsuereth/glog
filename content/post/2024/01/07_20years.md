Today the Glog turns 20 years old.  Or really, [my first posted review]($SiteBaseURL$2004/01/07/mario-kart-double-dash-2/) turns 20, that post having lived through multiple iterations of web-based complaints about videogames.  The precise birthdate of "Glog" may be lost to time.

My writing style has certainly changed since 2004, as has my taste in games; heck, games themselves are pretty different these days.  *Back in my day,* every <tag:Final Fantasy> installment was a huge event, and you'd spend *years* looking forward to the next, new epic adventure--

Oh, what's that?  Square was already [churning out spinoffs](game:Final Fantasy X-2) and [MMO timesinks](game:Final Fantasy XI Online) by 2004?  Hm.

Compared to the preceding 20 years - starting in the mid-80s with [a great crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_crash_of_1983) and somehow ending with [consoles on the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_network) - recent game industry history seems much less volatile.  Games sure are **bigger** than they were, in your web browser and on your mobile phone, [reaching so many people](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dfc-global-game-audience-reaches-37-billion) and [costing so much to make](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/12/21/a-300-million-spider-man-2-budget-sonys-future-and-aaa-unsustainability/), it'd make those 20th-century game devs' eyes water.

I think I've been reading those "AAA Unsustainability" headlines for about 20 years, too.

Well, here's to another several decades of this silly little hundred-billion-dollar commercial art form, and of me continuing to complain about it.
