I hate when story content is *taken* from me; when some seemingly-insignificant event, like a flap of a butterfly's wing - or even *in*action, like walking past an NPC - results in a locked door or a dead character and a swath of narrative is gone forever.  Poor [Counsellor Florrick](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Florrick), I'm sorry I missed you in Act 1, and you never got the chance to pull me into a prison break.

So I can't feel too bad about reading guides online that spoil quest events and possible outcomes.  Wish I'd done more of it before Act 3!  Because BG3's story content is **great**, amusing and enthralling and well worth the effort to research and prepare for.

It's the party's strong personalities and intricate backstories, really, that tie the 150-hour experience together.  And I love how those backstories all get extra-special attention in Act 3.

The overall plot is fine, too, I mean... a world-ending monster threat with light political conspiracy, assembling allies and collecting magic macguffins, ain't exactly groundbreaking.  Expository scenes do well at conveying *danger*, as dialogs with high-profile NPCs make you feel small in the face of grave evils; and it's got fascinating ties into the world's deep lore (plus a few callbacks to [the previous games](tag:Baldur's Gate)).

But, for the most part, the main quest is just an excuse for your motley crew of party members to banter and bond and solve mysteries together.

And to swing axes and shoot fireballs at enemy chumps, of course -- but the turn-based combat honestly feels less compelling towards the end of the game, especially after reaching the level cap (only 12? *really?*).  It was a little disappointing that so many Act 3 quests dumped their experience point rewards into the void, although I get that Larian didn't want me getting *too* overpowered and trivializing endgame boss fights.

(I still would've liked to, though.  To get *too* overpowered.)

The combat, while fun and more-or-less easy to approach, isn't really the point though.  The point is that I saved Karlach from her doom in Avernus; opened Lae'zel's eyes to the truth of her oppressors; rescued Wyll from his devil's bargain; helped some helpless, toppled some big bads, found some long-lost treasures, and generally *inhabited* the world of Baldur's Gate 3 in a way that felt ... impactful.

I saved that world, in my own, personal way.  (With some help [from the internet](https://bg3.wiki/).)

**Better than**: <game:Dragon Age: Origins>, <game:Mass Effect 2>, <game:Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition>  
**Not as good as**: Well.  It's the best turn-based RPG I've played, I think.  
**Let's call it, on balance, as good as**: <game:Disco Elysium: The Final Cut> and <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt>
