In <game:Cat Quest III>, you're not just a cat adventurer, you're a cat **pirate**.  Why?  Because the world map is split into islands, and you need a ship to traverse its ocean.  Hence, pirates!

(And *pi-rats*, the sword-wielding rodents you'll be battling and plundering in this quest.)

Like earlier Cat Quests, this a basic action RPG: beat up enemies for experience points, find new weapons and armor to equip, follow quest markers to progress a surreal, pun-filled story.  The world and its ~~tail~~ tale may be a little *weird*, but it's thoroughly light-hearted and fun to play through.

And like in <game:Cat Quest II>, you can bring a co-op partner along for this quest (though there's no AI buddy, this time).  Aside from a small handful of two-player-hostile level designs - like a spike-filled maze where if your partner gets stuck, the fixed camera won't let you proceed - it's a slick and straightforward co-op experience.

Encounters are pretty un-complicated, so you don't need to coordinate or strategize much, beyond making sure that someone has the "Furry Shield" spell ready.  And if a fight does get too hard, there're plenty of sidequests available to grind more experience and upgrades; bounties to hunt and hidden treasures to find.

There does seem to be less content overall than the second game had, but Cat Quest III is still getting updates -- [like just this week](https://steamcommunity.com/games/2305840/announcements/detail/4441207839043616819)!  And everything in this game feels highly polished, finely-tuned and *delightful*.

(Yeah, Dratcula's Castle is a real treat for <tag:Castlevania> aficionados.)

Cat Quest is a simple and fun time.  I'm really looking forward to more updates; maybe there'll be some kind of [Xmas update]($SiteBaseURL$2017/12/27/meowy-xmas/) next month.
