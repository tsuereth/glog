Way back in 2006, when I played <game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow> *then* the preceding [Aria of Sorrow](game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow), Aria felt familiar but simple and "kind of short."  This year, playing [Aria's modern re-release](game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (2021)) *then* [Dawn](game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow (2024))'s, the sequel feels familiar but ... complicated and slightly long.  Huh.

Weapon Synthesis is a cool addition to the 'vania power grind, giving you a clear series of goals for incremental weapon upgrades, but the fact that upgrades consume souls - sometimes even one-of-a-kind *boss* souls - makes some of them not worth the cost.

And broadly speaking, your inventory and the map and the bestiary (and even the story) are all "bigger" but not necessarily better; scrolling through shop menus still sucks, fast-travel points are still of *mixed* convenience, and a lot of enemy souls (even rare ones) seem like low-value filler.

But, even with rough edges, Dawn of Sorrow remains a satisfying and substantial example of the [IGA-vania](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Metroidvania) formula: exploring and slaying and collecting and upgrading your way to becoming an over-powered superhero.

This re-release is absolutely the best way to experience it, too, because - aside from awkward [touch-screen "seal" sequences](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Seal) - the <game:Castlevania Dominus Collection> has *brilliantly* re-evaluated how to organize this game's visual information.  Instead of simply replicating the <platform:NDS>'s top and bottom screens, where originally one screen swapped between "map" and "status" modes, this collection's default UI cleverly displays **both** support screens right next to the main action.

Short of something like a full-on remake in a modern game engine (which does kinda exist, in [Bloodstained](game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night)), Dominus Collection has done a really impressive job of *upgrading* the DS Castlevania games while still preserving their original content.

I'm really looking forward to [the next one](game:Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin (2024)).

**Better than**: <game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow (2021)>, I mean, even if not *much* better; Dawn is still a successful sequel.  
**Not as good as**: a "real" new Metroidvania, I guess? maybe <game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night>?  
**While I'm still waiting for Ritual of the Night 2**: at least I've got plenty more Dominus Collection to go.

*Progress: Killed Menace, 100% map, 100% souls.  (But gave up on [Julius Mode](https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Julius_Mode), I'd rather collect more souls!)*
