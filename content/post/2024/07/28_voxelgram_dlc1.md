<game:Voxelgram> was one of my [favorites in 2021]($SiteBaseURL$2022/01/01/2021-in-review-not-dead-yet/), so I was thrilled to see its [new DLC](game:Voxelgram: DLC #1) come up for sale.  No-brainer.

What was really surprising, though, was booting Voxelgram back up and seeing *even more* [new puzzles, added for free](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158470/view/4963541146758479893).

Some of these fuckers - *I mean that affectionately* - some of these new puzzles get up to an eye-watering 15 x 15 x 15.  Thousands and thousands of voxels!

Honestly, that immense scale of nonogram and all its toilsome scanning and rotating and re-scanning is asking a lot, even for a superfan like myself.  So it's a good thing that *another* recent update [added hint highlights](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158470/view/4227272901028323267), making it easy to find the next step in these massive grids.

I'm very satisfied with Voxelgram's DLC pack, hopefully the first of many, but moreover I'm blown away by the game's commitment to new content and features -- years after its initial release.
