If "<tag:The Defenestration Trilogy>" wasn't clear-enough branding, <game:Tactical Breach Wizards> - based on the free demo - is very up-front with its tone: magic-wielding special-ops soldiers trade irreverent banter, then knock down doors and blast baddies.  (**Yes**, often out a window.)  Like <game:Gunpoint>, this game's narrative elements are *unflinchingly* sarcastic and irreverent, and I love it.

But the tactical gameplay ... I dunno, I'm not "feeling" it.  Even though it completely avoids the unpredictable dice-roll fuck-ups that I often associate with tactical games - "high-hit-percent missed-shot bullshit" as I lamented in [Shadowrun: Dragonfall]($SiteBaseURL$2021/04/03/gotta-keep-running/) - because all actions are totally deterministic, and you can even rewind turns to try a different approach.

Really, Tactical Breach Wizards combat is more like a chess puzzle, asking you to figure out the right moves to stay alive and kill the bad dudes.  And I guess that "figure out" part is what I'm not feeling: staring at the map to plan out each move is kinda boring.  (Rewind-ability means I could just *try stuff*, too, but I'm not stoked on the idea of retrying moves over and over again.)

As much as I like the game's personality, its fully-predictable game mechanics are ironically too dull to hold my interest.
