... like I [was just saying]($SiteBaseURL$2024/09/29/a-whip-blast-from-advances-past/), [Aria of Sorrow](game:Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow)'s introduction of collectible soul-powers, its variety of equippable weapons and fighting techniques, and its modern setting are all refreshing and exciting changes to the <tag:Castlevania> norm.

Back when I [first played it]($SiteBaseURL$2006/05/29/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow-2/), I'd *already* finished [Dawn of Sorrow](game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow), so Aria couldn't help but pale in comparison.  Now that I've blissfully forgotten the details of the sequel -- I can really appreciate how strong this game is on its own.

Even if some aspects of its storytelling and user interface feel a bit outdated, the foundations that would become "Igavania" - the same principles which eventually made <game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night> so compelling - are all accounted for, and already working well.

No joke: [I said that in Bloodstained]($SiteBaseURL$2019/06/30/what-is-an-igavania-a-joyful-little-pile-of-secrets/),

> It almost always feels like you're accomplishing something, even if only in small increments, toward the ultimate goal of overpowering evil. Bloodstained is at its best when it's giving you plenty of opportunities for continuous improvement.

And that's just as true all the way back in Aria of Sorrow; true enough for me to *enjoy* late-game grinds for experience and gear and souls, completing the game's checklists, and overpowering myself enough to turn the final bosses into total chumps.

It's a great formula, and its execution here is quite good, in spite of the <platform:GBA>'s limited horsepower (and number of buttons).  Now, a couple decades and multiple sequels in this game's future, I could lament that some quality-of-life annoyances - like hidden progression requirements, and inconvenient fast-travel locations - *still* haven't seen much improvement.

But I love IGA's castle-crawling adventures all the same, and even after a dozen hours in this one, I still *want more*.

**Better than**: <game:Castlevania: Circle of the Moon>, <game:Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance>  
**Not as good as**: well, the next one, <game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow>  
**... so, it's a good thing**: the <game:Castlevania Dominus Collection> is finally here, and I can play *that* again too!

*Progress: Killed Chaos, 100% map, 100% souls.*
