<game:Stormgate>'s game-mode ambitions are pretty grand - narrative campaigns *and* ranked competitive *and* PvE co-op missions - its [ex-Blizzard creators](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/blizzard-vets-form-frost-giant-studios) evidently aiming to make The Next Blizzard-Style RTS themselves.  And while it's certainly normal for Early Access games to feel **unfinished**, well, Stormgate's got plenty of work left to do.

What I find funny is the game's apparent *lack* of ambition in faction designs.  The [Infernal Host](https://stormgate.fandom.com/wiki/Infernal_Host) grow drones into Giger-esque structures just like the [Zerg](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Zerg); the [Celestial Armada](https://stormgate.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial_Armada) have glowing power networks and robotic, aloof moods just like the [Protoss](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Protoss); heck, the [Vanguard](https://stormgate.fandom.com/wiki/Vanguard)'s worker units quip *"In the rear with the beer"* in un-subtle homage to the [Terran](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Terran) SCV's *"In the rear with the gear"* line.

Sure, designing new themes and mechanics in the RTS space [can be risky](game:Grey Goo), but to so clearly ape a genre legend risks disappearing in its shadow.  Like they say, you come at the king -- you best not miss.
