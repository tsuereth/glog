Imagine - *what if* - after 2011's <game:Saints Row: The Third>, Volition had **not** pushed the franchise even further into [zany crazy-pants town](game:Saints Row IV) -- if instead, they'd kept doing the "[San Andreas](game:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) successor" thing, following a hyperviolent crime boss's rise to power.

Now imagine that their next try didn't just reboot its location, story, and characters; it re-iterated virtually all of the last game's features and activities, re-implemented the same loose aiming and floaty driving, and ended up being basically... the same game again.

You don't have to imagine hard: it's <game:Saints Row (2022)>, the story of a new "boss" in a new city.  You make friends with some gung-ho personalities, make enemies with three rival gangs, shoot your way through over-the-top heists and chases and rescues, earn money by running drugs and falling in front of cars ([Insurance Fraud](https://saintsrow.fandom.com/wiki/Insurance_Fraud)), claim criminal enterprises, grow territory, and collect outfits.

Y'know, just like in Saints Row 3.

After a few introductory missions establishing the cast, which could just as well have been cut, the reboot turns into that same crime-boss ascent story with the same structure and minigames we've seen before.  It'd be a respectable "clone" of The Third, if it was from a different developer ... and wasn't more than ten years later.

What's strange is that Volition *did* embrace their wackier side, after SR3, in its alien-Matrix super-powered sequel and a [spinoff in literal Hell](game:Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell).  Then <game:Agents of Mayhem>, though not as bombastic as I'd have liked, built new strength-and-weakness mechanics around its superhero team premise.  The Saints Row reboot, in contrast, is uncreative and unambitious; like it's not even trying to do anything Saints Row hasn't done before.

(Except pad the outer areas of the map with mostly-empty desert regions.  Which *suck*.)

What's also strange is that <game:Saints Row: The Third Remastered> came out *just* before this reboot.  I mean, it makes sense if Volition's business plan was to start cranking out yearly installments of the same formula, and oversaturate their own market, <tag:Assassin's Creed>-style.  *But I digress.*

Here's the upside: this Saints Row 3 re-skin isn't "bad," in pure gameplay and content terms.  As a franchise addict, I happily - or at least, contentedly - sank hours and hours into the seen-this-done-that activities I've just been complaining about.  Even the ultra-brief story DLCs [The Heist & The Hazardous](game:Saints Row: The Heist & The Hazardous) and [A Song of Ice & Dust](game:Saints Row: A Song of Ice & Dust) were, like [Gangstas in Space](game:Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space) and [The Trouble with Clones](game:Saints Row: The Third - The Trouble with Clones) before them, a fun-enough way to spend an hour or two.

But the reboot still isn't "as good as" Saints Row: The Third due to its **technical infidelity**.  Frequent framerate stutters are sometimes violent enough to interfere with driving or aiming.  You can see cars pop-in down any highway; I even noticed *pop-out* sometimes, a car next to me suddenly fading away!  Occasionally reloading a gun plays the animation, but doesn't put any ammo in.

And non-critically, but very visibly, voiceover playback seems to always drift from video framerate -- resulting in subtitles and lipsync not matching audible dialog.

The in-game phone having an **ad for the [Murder Circus DLC](game:Saints Row: Doc Ketchum's Murder Circus)** is just a bitter-tasting cherry on top.

At its best, Saints Row (2022) is a more-modern re-do of Saints Rows past.  But, it isn't always at its best.

**Better than**: <game:Agents of Mayhem>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Saints Row: The Third Remastered>  
**Credit where it's due**: the *Mad Max*-ian LARPing missions with Eli are legitimately hilarious.  Play-fighting dudes in cardboard costumes is a delightful twist on normal combat.
