*Finally*, after treading (re-treading) through the growing pains of new cast members in [Apollo Justice](game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney) and new three-dee technology in [Dual Destinies](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies), [Spirit of Justice](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice) feels like a confident return to Ace Attorney's sweeping melodrama -- interspersed by investigative minigames and courtroom hijinks.

Kinda ironic that, [back in 2017]($SiteBaseURL$2017/04/07/keeping-justice-alive/), I called out Spirit of Justice for its "safe" narrative focus and for doing "so little to build on the series' gameplay."  In retrospect, maintaining a priority on Ace Attorney's storytelling strengths was definitely the right call.

Sure, these cases can be rightly accused of rejecting reasonable evidence -- several cross-examinations requiring you to "Present" a counter-intuitive item.  And, following recent games' precedent, other courtroom mechanics like Apollo's Perceive - or even the new Divination Seance - don't get much use.

At least out-of-court investigations are more open to Examine-ation, and chock full of flavor text, compared to Dual Destinies.

... but my point is, what makes Spirit of Justice compelling and memorable - maybe *more* now, than on a tiny <platform:3DS> screen - is the same grandiose storytelling, tying up multiple cases and *previous games* in a wonderfully satisfying bow, that <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy> and <game:The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles> did so well.

It keeps its lead characters grounded and relatable, by taking us along with them through crazy, bewildering events.  It delivers heavy plot moments, made impactful by our attachments to the main cast.  And it keeps things *interesting* with a colorful menagerie of zany supporting players.

*And of course*, Spirit of Justice also recognizes the value of fan service, with a tension-breaking 4th case featuring Athena and Simon.  (Plus [that DLC episode](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Special Episode - Turnabout Time Traveler) reuniting the old gang of Nick, Maya, Miles, and Larry.)

Considering there isn't much Ace Attorney left for Capcom to re-release - [Professor Layton Versus](game:Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) being a Level-5 collab, and [Edgeworth's investigations](tag:Ace Attorney Investigations) being ... *limited* - I can't help but wonder **what's next**.  Dare I dream for some news about Athena's law career, and Apollo's Khura'in office, in an Ace Attorney 7?

Dare I hope?

**Better than**: as a collection, <game:The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles>  
**Not as good as**: as a collection, <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy>  
**I mean, I'll rag on it**: but I'd still buy a remastered <tag:Ace Attorney Investigations> collection, if they made it.  'Cause I'm a sucker.
