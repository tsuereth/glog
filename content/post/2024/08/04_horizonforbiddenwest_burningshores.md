What did I say about <game:Horizon Forbidden West> [last time]($SiteBaseURL$2022/04/09/horizon-2-more-horizons/)?  That it plays to the "same strengths" and hits the "same highs" as [Zero Dawn](game:Horizon Zero Dawn)?  Well, **yeah**, though that's an awfully succinct way to describe a world I've spent over a hundred hours in.

I'd forgotten how *varied* this map is: from canyons and deserts to forests and beaches, icy mountain peaks and treetop villages to overgrown skyscrapers and >!underwater Vegas!<, and all of it chock-full of *activities*.  Tribal NPCs with side-quests to chase, rebel outposts to reclaim, lore-heavy collectables to unearth, components to gather for equipment upgrades!

Forbidden West's world is *so damn captivating*, I really couldn't help but keep returning to wring out every last drop of it.

And the [second time around](https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Time_Around_Season_Finale), it was pretty easy for me to ignore trivial shortcomings like inventory management.  (Just had to always remember to "refill from stash.")

The plot isn't as jaw-dropping as Zero Dawn's - a high bar for sure - and ultimately Far Zenith felt more like a setup for Aloy's next game.  Her motley crew of allies, though, help add meaning to this journey: it's always a delight listening to Erend's struggles with technology, to Kotallo's swearings of vengeance, to Alva's *manic joy for data*.

As for [Burning Shores](game:Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores), well -- like [Frozen Wilds](game:Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds) before it, this expansion is a perfectly serviceable and enjoyable addition to the main game, not much more.

Londra's story tries to embellish those *rascally Zeniths* with a deep-dive into one *particular* narcissist, but it doesn't add much substance to the space wizards we already knew.  (Though his Pangea Park is a fun excuse for glib Jurassic Park references.)  And new companion Seyka has an engaging personality, but is no substitute for the *group* of friends that came along with Aloy in the main game.

Flying on a ptero-bot mount was a thrilling, climactic upgrade in Forbidden West, unlocking free exploration of the whole map; creating a new problem in Burning Shores, whose new map would be trivialized if you could fly over it immediately.  It was smart of Guerrilla Games to invent a flight block that you could later remove, so once you defeat Londra's anti-air space-magic laser, you can fly around LA's ruins too -- it's just a shame that the main game's grand capstone moment had to be undone (and then rehashed) for the expansion's sake.

I wish Burning Shores had added more off-the-beaten-path sidequests and activities.  I mean, what's here is fine, a little unraveling of the Quen's org chart and some more flight recorder stories from Operation: Enduring Victory, I just ... wanted *more*.

Not that the "complete edition" package of Forbidden West is lacking content.  *Man*.  The hundred-plus hours I clocked uncovering this world's mysteries, solving its people's problems, upgrading my weapons to blow up robot dinosaurs, I loved all of it.

Except maybe those Gauntlet Run races.  Could do without those in Horizon 3.

*Progress: finished on Normal, 95.96% main game progression, 92.00% Burning Shores progression*
