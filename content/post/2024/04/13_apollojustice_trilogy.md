[Dual Destinies](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies) was Phoenix and co's first 3D adventure - barring the Japanese release of [that wacky detective crossover](game:Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) - and, just like I was [a decade ago]($SiteBaseURL$2013/12/01/hold-it/), I'm impressed by how well their over-the-top art style has been translated.

<tag:Ace Attorney>'s knack for eccentric characters carries a lot of water for this game's overall story -- like I also [observed back in 2013]($SiteBaseURL$2013/12/12/ace-attorney-is-fine-everything-is-going-to-be-fine/), the early cases are underwhelming, and its "dark age of the law" plot doesn't really get rolling until quite late.

Dual Destinies also under-delivers on the "investigation" part of its gameplay formula, as a lot of scenes don't even *have* an Examine button -- and this lack of interactivity and [flavor text](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText) makes the early cases' slow-moving narratives stand out even more.

At least newcomer Athena's "mood matrix" mechanic gets plenty of opportunities to spice up conversations and cross-examinations.  The variety here is a welcome improvement on how anemically [Apollo's debut]($SiteBaseURL$2024/03/02/cold-cases/) used his own new trick.

(Alhough it's disappointing that Ema's forensic evidence minigames are totally absent, until the [Turnabout Reclaimed DLC case](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies: Special Episode - Turnabout Reclaimed).)

In the end, while I'll still heap praise upon this game's characters and overall *flair* ...

... the bulk of its cases aren't all that engaging, in their investigations nor in their narrative pacing.

Given that, I'm not sure whether I should expect [Spirit of Justice](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice) to have aged more gracefully.
