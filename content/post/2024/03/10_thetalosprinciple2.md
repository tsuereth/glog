-- *Byron (7)*

<game:The Talos Principle II> feels like it was made *for* me.  Not just because it's a [story-driven puzzle sandbox](game:Piczle Cross Adventure), or because it includes [first-person physics riddles](game:Portal 2), or even because it's an all-around improvement upon [the first game](game:The Talos Principle).  Talos 2 is downright **targeting me** with its housecat-informed philosophizing.

This sequel improves what I found wanting, *and* enhances what I loved, about the 2014 original: fully-voiced NPCs with memorable personalities enrich its narrative, new puzzle tools strongly distinguish it from the first game, and some new design directives - especially, numbered puzzles with accumulating complexity - were a huge help in *teaching me how* to apply those tools and reason through the game's challenges.

That's in contrast to The Talos Principle's later stages [leaving me bitter]($SiteBaseURL$2021/05/16/the-talos-practice/) when I felt stuck, forced to look up hints on the interweb.  Talos 2 puts in the effort to carefully build its complexity, one puzzle at a time, so that you *won't need* hints -- you'll readily recognize twists on patterns you've solved before, and can make informed guesses about how previously-isolated tools might work together.

(... there are, in this game's "best ending" endgame challenges, some impossible-to-find scavenger hunts and a few can't-reverse-mistakes puzzles that I still needed hints on.  But these frustrations are fewer and shorter-lived than last time around.)

As I noted [when playing the demo]($SiteBaseURL$2023/10/29/well-principled/), Talos 2's fresh and diverse environments are also a visual treat, evoking the serene-yet-mysterious feel of <game:Myst> or <game:The Witness (2016)>.  Talos 2's world isn't really that "open" - each of its 12 regions is unlocked in order, by story progress - but the spaces between puzzles *feel* very open to free-form exploration.

The Talos Principle II's scripted story, its philosophical backdrop, its brain-tickling puzzle gameplay, and its charming world, all feel like excellent upgrades on the last game; and despite lacking [nonograms](game:Voxelgram) or [computer programming](tag:Zachtronics), it really does feel perfectly tailored just for me.

**Better than**: <game:The Talos Principle>, <game:The Witness (2016)>  
**Not as good as**: ... the third game might be? I guess?  
**More substantial, and arguably better!, than**: <game:Portal 2>
