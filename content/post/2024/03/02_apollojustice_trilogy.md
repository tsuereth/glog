[Sixteen years ago]($SiteBaseURL$2008/03/10/apollo-justice-ace-attorney-3/), I called out <game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney> for its muddled story direction, especially in its final time-hopping case; and, well, this is still the same game.

Ace Attorney 4 was bold enough to propose a new lead character, with his own engaging personality, while still *including* Phoenix Wright in the main plot.  Apollo deserves considerable credit for stepping into Phoenix's wingtips as comfortably as he does.

It's a shame that his Perceive ability gets so little use, and new assistant Trucy doesn't bring any new gameplay into the courtroom either.  At least Ema is back with some forensic science minigames, I guess.

What Trucy does contribute, if not gameplay twists, is ... *precociousness*.

That's this game's saving grace, that despite its awkwardly-paced story and missed mechanical opportunities - and an annoying number of leap-of-logic evidence puzzles in the final case - it does pull off enough of that Ace Attorney humor, and *style*, to stay charming all the way through.

This may be a relatively weak entry in the Ace Attorney franchise, but clicking through its narrative is still satisfying and worthwhile.
