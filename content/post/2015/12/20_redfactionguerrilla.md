Six years later, {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla{{% /game %}} still has no problem absolutely entrancing me.  Of course it helps that the "Steam Edition" released last year included a nice renderer upgrade; Guerrilla looks better than a six-year-old game has any right to.

But what makes Guerrilla one of history's finest pieces of explosion-based art isn't its visual prowess, nor the throwaway story and characters.  It's the fact that you can crash a truck through the front of a suspension bridge, hang out on your artificial island, launch rockets at hostile fighters, and use your jetpack to escape to the valley below.  And then home-run a guy with your sledgehammer, sending his ragdoll flying into the Martian rocks.

I don't need a new open-world destruction game, at least not yet.  This one is still good.

<i>Progress: Replayed the campaign, 20 missions and 51 guerrilla actions completed.</i>
