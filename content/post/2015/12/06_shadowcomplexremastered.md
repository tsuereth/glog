<game:Shadow Complex Remastered> is not an exceptional example of <i>remastering</i>: While this iteration does have high-quality textures, and can run at modern resolutions, other technical aspects of the game are unmistakably from a six-year-old downloadable title.  Cutscene close-ups show a dearth of model polygons.  Movement animations lack the smooth sophistication of current-day motion capture.  Even the voice samples audibly suffer when a character yells too loudly.

But that aside, it's still <game:Shadow Complex>, and it's still a great <game:Metroid>-alike.  This is just about as good a time as you can have sneaking through a facility, finding hidden passages, collecting upgrades, and punching paramilitary stooges to death.

And sure, it still has the original game's pacing issues, and frustrating depth-based aiming problems.  But it's also <b>free</b>.  That's a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/shadowcomplex/">solid deal</a>.

<b>Better than</b>: The original <game:Shadow Complex>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Dust: An Elysian Tail>  
<b>And again, uh</b>: Free.  Well, free with an Epic Games account, and via their Epic Games Launcher, which exists for some fucking reason.

<i>Progress: Finished the story, 89\% map completion, 60\% item collection.</i>
