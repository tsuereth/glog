I fucking love picross!  Nonograms!  Shit is tight.  And apparently I'm <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2015/12/20/all-through-the-house">not the only one</a> -- yes, we are a cult in very high esteem/notoriety/infamy.

Anyway.  <game:Paint it Back>'s simple aesthetic belies a <b>stunningly</b> rich amount of puzzle content.  This ain't no bite-sized <game:Picross e> slapjob; there are, uh, <i>152</i> puzzles?  That I know of?  Plus a mode that throws out random puzzles, which, I don't know how many of those there are.  Maybe an infinite amount?  No, that's not mathematically possible.  But probably <i>a fucking lot</i>.

And PiB doesn't shy away from complex puzzles, either.  At about the halfway point, I'm already doing puzzles larger and more intricate than the endgame boards from <game:Picross DS>, my previous record-holder for most intimidating nonogram.  There are some <b>40x30</b> boards I can see in the back.  My brain is salivating all over itself for those.

These puzzles are at their best when they're sprawling and meticulous, forcing a patient approach to inductive logic and pattern recognition.  And this game is picross at its best.

<i>Progress: 79 puzzles complete, 151 medals</i>
