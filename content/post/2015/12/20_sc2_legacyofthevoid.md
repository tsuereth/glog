It isn't even fair to say that [Legacy of the Void](game:StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void)'s terrible storytelling is handicapped by the fact that the protoss, as a race, are designed explicitly for us mere humans to have difficulty empathizing with.  That they don't have mouths, tend to speak in a businesslike way, and walk around adorned with wacky-looking ornate bullshit -- none of this stopped the campaign's most interesting character, a Tal'darim protoss named Alarak, from stealing the show every time he appeared in it.

Void's underwhelming, hackneyed plot is really just another indictment in Blizzard's last [several](game:Diablo III) [years](game:World of Warcraft) of not caring about any of the substance behind its lavish cutscenes.  In lieu of interesting new ideas, they keep trying to <i>explain</i> the mysteries behind the old ideas - the Horadrim, the xel'naga, what have you - which only ruins the existing lore's mystique.

But I digress.  You shouldn't care about Void's stupid story -- because the campaign missions are, as in [Wings](game:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty) and [Swarm](game:StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm), generally well-crafted and exciting.  Aside from the last couple, which get really fucking annoying, there are some creatively satisfying objectives and mechanics to play with here.  Particularly memorable are the on-foot missions that have you controlling multiple hero units, managing their superpower abilities in tandem.

And as before, progression through the campaign brings unit upgrades that both call back to [classic](game:StarCraft) [content](game:StarCraft: Brood War) and introduce brand new abilities.  The Tal'darim Void Ray, for example, fires multiple beams at multiple targets.  It is <i>hype</i>.

I may not give a shit about Amon or whatever, but Legacy of the Void gave me several evenings' worth of fun missions to play through, and that's pretty good.

<b>Better than</b>: Mechanically and architecturally, both [Wings of Liberty](game:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty) and [Heart of the Swarm](game:StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: Narratively, both [Wings of Liberty](game:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty) and [Heart of the Swarm](game:StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm)  
<b>It's a shame</b>: that <game:Grey Goo>, which had a really engaging aliens-at-war story from what I saw, couldn't have been more fun to play.

<i>Progress: Finished the campaign and epilogue.</i>
