One "trick" in <game:SquareCells> was shifting from a fill-based to a clear-based system, i.e. whereas most picross games allow free marking of non-filled squares, SquareCells is the opposite.  Unfortunately, since SquareCells lacks a "try it out"-style system, it's difficult to distinguish between squares that are definitely filled and squares which are only hypothetically filled based on some deductive guess -- making it impractical to play such hypotheses, as opposed to just marking stuff and seeing if the game allows it.

Some puzzles made really good use of combinations of clues, hopping back and forth between clue types to deduct how a block of squares was supposed to fit together.  But other puzzles, especially in the last set, were over-reliant on playing so many moves ahead that it was indistinguishable from randomly guessing and seeing if it worked.  Which isn't very satisfying.

And in the end, with only 36 puzzles, the good in SquareCells wasn't really enough to outweigh the annoying.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Gemsweeper>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Picross e>  
<b>And another thing</b>: Leaving the Unity default logo as your application icon?  Pretty amateurish.
