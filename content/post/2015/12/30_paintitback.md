I spent... oh, wow.  Thirty hours?  On these puzzles.  That's a lot of puzzle.

No regrets.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Picross DS>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: Well, it doesn't have as <i>many</i> puzzles as Picross DS, but I still think Paint it Back is better due to its ultimate puzzle complexity.  
<b>What would be even cooler</b>: Is DLC, and/or Steam Workshop integration for community puzzles.  Yeah, that would be pretty <i>dope</i>.

<i>Progress: All puzzles complete, 329 medals.</i>
