Prime factorization really took it out of me.  I admit it!  <i>I need high-level programming.</i>  Ugh.  That was painful.

That being said, without the benefit of seeing my scores above my friends' on an easy-to-read graph, the prospect of revisiting my solutions for optimization is not quite appealing enough.  I guess my optimization ego is not as much of a "pride" thing as it is a "jerk" thing.  Oh, well.

<i>Progress: Finished all levels, not most optimization challenges.</i>
