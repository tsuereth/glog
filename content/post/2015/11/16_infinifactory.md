{{% game "Infinifactory" %}}Infinifactory{{% /game %}} is more than just {{% game "SpaceChem" %}}SpaceChem{{% /game %}} in 3D -- it also has <i>gravity</i>.

I mean, it's not fair to call Infinifactory more of the same from Zachtronics.  It's a remarkably polished approach to three-dimensional time-based assembly-line puzzles, and even has some pleasant lore-building in the form of {{% game "Half-Life" %}}Half-Life{{% /game %}}-style ambient scenes.

But at the same time, it's impossible to deny Infinifactory's pedigree ... and that's a <b>very</b> good thing.  Unlike so many other physics-based puzzle games, it doesn't feel like a total crapshoot of pixel-twitch aiming and realtime actions; this is visibly and repeatably deterministic, just like a puzzle game is supposed to be.

I can't wait to come back to this guy when I have more time.  Maybe after I finally give up on {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}}.
