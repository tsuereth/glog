> Back in the <game:StarCraft> and [Brood War](game:StarCraft: Brood War) days, the backstory barely intruded into the game at all, and it's hard not to miss that here. The narrative between missions in [Heart of the Swarm], more often than not, feels like wasteful filler.

Has it really been... huh, yeah, {{% abslink href="2013/05/24/three-more-years/" %}}almost three years{{% /abslink %}}.  And as for Legacy of the Void, or at least its "Whispers of Oblivion" mini-campaign preview, it looks like more of the same.

[Wings of Liberty](game:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty) and [Heart of the Swarm](game:StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm) turned Zeratul into a complete MacGuffin, appearing out of thin air to tease Raynor about the xel'naga or the hybrid threat, and - contrary to the other characters' flat personalities - never presenting <i>any</i> personality at all.  If Legacy of the Void is to be his campaign, I dread a story that isn't just embarrassing, but outright dull.

But that probably won't stop me from playing it.  Even though the mini-campaign's three missions didn't diverge very much from established StarCraft campaign mechanics (going so far as to combine a small base-building mission with an infiltrate-the-laboratory mission).  It's still good fun.  And if I can take out narrative enemies by massing Void Rays like an asshole, then, hell yeah.
