Amazon kept recommending it to me, so I saw a free demo on Steam and took a shot at it; and I'm glad I did.  Not because the game is good, because it isn't - it's awful.  But Rayne is <i>hot</i>.  So when she leaps onto a femme vampire in a bustier and sinks her teeth into the chick's neck ... anyway, I'm glad I tried it.

A full purchase is out of the question.  BloodRayne 2 (and I haven't played [the first one](game:BloodRayne), but I can assume that it has the same features, or less) tries to merge several gameplay concepts, but is pretty terrible at all of them.  It has environmental acrobatics a'la <tag:Prince of Persia>, but the controls for these are stupid, and half the time don't even go in the direction you're trying for.  It has <i>shooting</i>, but you can't really <i>aim</i>, which makes that a bit difficult.  It has hand-to-hand fighting, which is totally brainless because she has swords and just cuts everything in pieces.

The gore factor is kinda neat, in that you can slice up your enemies and their limbs fall into huge puddles of blood and so forth.  But other than that, and the tits, there are no redeeming factors here.
