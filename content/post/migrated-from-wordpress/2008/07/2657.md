I <i>was</i> planning on waiting to buy BioShock until I got a better graphics card - my <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130316">current one</a> runs the demo like shit.  But Steam had to go and have <i>another</i> sale.  For $15, I can't say no.

Now I'll just be sitting on it until I can actually play it decently.
