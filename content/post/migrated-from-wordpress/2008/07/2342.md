Playing RSPD is a little like reading archived <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a> comics in a row for a few hours.  The writing and artistic style are the same, and it's damn funny.  Some parts, e.g. the mysterious narrator, may seem a little over-the-top sometimes, but in general it's still high quality humor.

Some outlets have given the game flak for the actual gameplay being not-so-good, and what you should know is that it's not <i>bad</i>.  Sure, you may be able to buy a game with more refined and intriguing RPG elements in a box on a store shelf, but considering it's not even the primary bullet point of RSPD, the real-time menu-based combat (think Final Fantasy 4-9) is actually fun.

I've only played the demo so far - need to clear out some time in my schedule before I can justify buying the whole game - but it's a definite sell for me, and at this point I'm pretty much sold on the rest of the series' episodes, too.

EDIT: it was on sale this weekend on <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=posts&id=1697&cc=US">Steam</a>, so, I leapt.  I haven't started playing yet, but this bumps it up in the queue...
