As I play, Sly Cooper alternately impresses and depresses me.  One moment, I'll jump into a level with a clever mechanic - like faux-sidescrolling or a truck race - and feel like this game has some really creative ideas behind it.  The next moment, the camera will get stuck behind a signpost, or I'll be one-shotted by some enemy (remember: there are no health points), and the last checkpoint was forever ago, and I just want to throw down the controller in frustration.

I've only beaten two of the game's five bosses, and I frequently think of just tossing the disc back in its case forever.  But at the same time, the game's flaws are of the kind that could be easily fixed in [a sequel](game:Sly 2: Band of Thieves), if Sucker Punch were to deem it so.  At any rate, I can't help but press on so I can feel like I got the most out of Sly.
