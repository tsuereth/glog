As soon as I started GTA3, I could see a big distinction between it and [its](game:Grand Theft Auto: Vice City) [followers](game:Grand Theft Auto IV).  The first hint to it is in the game's approach to storytelling: GTA3 begins with a minutes-long premise-setting prologue cinema, but afterward there is not much in the way of exposition.  My protagonist has (at least so far) zero lines.  And the mafiosos who are giving me jobs seem content to sum up their orders in blunt one- or two-liners.

This air of simplicity extends to the gameplay, as well - GTA3's feature set is fairly small when compared to its sequels.  There is a lack of variety in the in-game radio stations; there aren't a ton of concurrent mission sources; there isn't a lot for me to do with the money I'm earning.  There's also some evidence of the lack of refinement from incremental development, in the uncooperative camera and the ease with which vehicles explode.  But the core gameplay, stealing fast cars and using them to barrel down city streets and mow down pedestrians, is already fairly solid.

GTA3 is a relatively limited package, but I'm quite enjoying it so far.  Plus, I can listen to "Take it to the Limit" on the radio.  Sweet.
