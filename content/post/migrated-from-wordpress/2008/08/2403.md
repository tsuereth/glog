I'm beginning to learn that it wasn't just a matter of me being bad at the game.  Hitman is kind of hard!  I'm having a better time of it now that I've gotten the basics of avoiding detection, and since I found the <i>save</i> feature: you have a limited number of saves from within the level, so you can make incremental progress, but not <i>too</i> incrementally.  But regardless, it is still a challenge figuring out how to accomplish the mission and get through the level in one piece, which I guess is the whole point of the game.

Right now I'm kind of lukewarm to it, but I'm holding out hope that it gets better - I've got an incentive in the form of [its](game:Hitman: Contracts) [sequels](game:Hitman: Blood Money) waiting for me in my game rack.
