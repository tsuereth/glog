Though it is shorter than its followers, GTA3 has its fair share of extra stuff too: rampages, vigilante/rescue/taxi missions, optional mission chains, stunt jumps, et cetera; not that I bothered with almost all of them, but they are there for your inner completionist if you have one.  And, in the end, I was pleasantly surprised by the story cohesion - it was still generally weak, but more than I was expecting.

All in all, I'm not sure what more I can say except, it's a fun game that has its problems, much like the sequels.
