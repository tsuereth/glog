I've actually had this sitting in my DS for about two months now.  I played it a little the night after I got it, and then didn't touch it again until the other evening, when my complex's transformers blew out and all my other games were unplayable.

It's not that I dislike the game, but, it hasn't really <i>hooked</i> me yet.  The super-complex combat gameplay I was looking for has barely even come up, as most of what I've played so far is scrolling through dialog.  And the story is intriguing, but also slightly off-putting because of the bizarre turns it takes (and because the main character is a total douche).

One of these days I'll get back to it; but right now the DS is just at the back of my list.
