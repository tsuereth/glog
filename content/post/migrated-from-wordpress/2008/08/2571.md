I keep taking extended breaks from Toki Tori, but I'm consistently pleased with it when I pick the game back up again.  The challenge level is really satisfying, and real-time actions are rarely a significant factor, making it great for just sitting back and thinking of how to complete the level.

And new items keep showing up, which really keeps the formula fresh even well into the game.  In World 4, Toki Tori falls <i>underwater</i>, and a sort of diving suit is introduced that allows you to swim upward for a limited number of spaces.  It dramatically changes the movement mechanics that drove the game previously, which is awesome.
