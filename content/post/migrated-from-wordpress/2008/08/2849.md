It is a wicked cool concept, and based on some multiplayer I tried when a co-worker brought the game in for lunch breaks, it is very fun in a party-style setting.  However, from what I've seen and heard of the multiplayer, the part I was really interested in - a lengthy, challenging, solo puzzle-solving mode - is seriously lacking.  I'm glad I got to try it, but I think I've already gotten what I can out of Boom Blox.
