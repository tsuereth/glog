I'll say it again - the multiplayer in Mario Kart Wii is phenomenal, and is sure to be a hit with parties.  But once you've played the new courses enough to find out how cool they are, single-player becomes the same boring venture [you've](game:Mario Kart 64) [already](game:Mario Kart: Double Dash!!) [played](game:Mario Kart DS).  I'm really not motivated enough to keep getting gold cups and star rankings to get the rest of the game's unlockables, even though there are a ton of them.
