Wii Ware, at last!  {{% game "Pop" %}}Pop{{% /game %}}, those weird Blackjack and Game Show games, and {{% game "Defend Your Castle" %}}Defend Your Castle{{% /game %}} haven't gotten me very worked up, and I still don't even know what the fuck {{% game "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - My Life as a King" %}}My Life as a King{{% /game %}} <i>is</i> - but I've been looking forward to LostWinds for quite a while.  And though I've just started, I'm already pretty satisfied.

You move the main character, Toku, with the nunchuk stick in sidescrolling platformer style.  Use the Wii remote to point as Enril, the wind spirit, and use wind magic to blow things around in the environment, up to and including Toku himself.  It's a very cool concept, which I think is the majority of the reason I like the game.

In terms of depth, there isn't much, at least it doesn't look like there will be.  The game world is fairly peaceful and slow-paced, and there isn't a ton of stuff to do.  But what LostWinds lacks in thrilling engagement, it makes up for in charm.  The environments look absolutely gorgeous, and the gameplay is a sort of relaxing fun.  I'm looking forward to seeing how long it lasts.
