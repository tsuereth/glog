Until I get a [new DS game](game:The World Ends with You), I've decided to pick up Picross again for not-at-my-TV downtime.  When I put the game down a few months back, I had just finished Normal Mode, meaning that now all I've got is Free Mode - which is supposed to be harder, but I actually find it more relaxing.  In Normal mode I was always getting penalties for a slip of the stylus, and getting all tense when I realized I had drawn myself into a mistake; but in Free mode, more often than not, I catch up to and correct minor errors by the puzzle's end with no real detriment.
