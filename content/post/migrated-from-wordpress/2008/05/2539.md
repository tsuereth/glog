What I said before about the game being hectic fun - as it turns out - does not always apply.  As one might be able to derive from the game's "catch-up" formula of packing racers together, players who are losing are usually having more fun; which makes multiplayer awesome, since if you're playing with four people, at least three of them must be losing!  This in turn means that <i>winning</i> is not incredibly fun, and has really not changed all that much from previous Mario Kart installments.

So while I'd heartily recommend Mario Kart for the party-game repertoire, and it's definitely the best in the series (the new level design is simply incredible), as a single-player venture it's not exactly what I'd call revolutionary.  Granted, I've not yet tried getting into the online multiplayer.
