I've actually been looking forward to this for a long time, since I read that it was a time-travel-based mystery game.  I love mysteries - and time travel!  But just today I read this in my new Nintendo Power:

<i>"While the puzzle-oriented point-and-click gameplay appears very promising, the storytelling and presentation should also be highlights: Time Hollow is cowritten by Junko Kawano (who previously explored intriguing time-travel themes in the underappreciated PlayStation 2 game <game:Shadow of Destiny>) [...]"</i>

Fuck!
