When I first heard about Boom Blox, I decided I would wait and see.  Well, I waited, and now [I've seen](game:Nintendo Channel).  As far as I can tell from the video, Boom Blox is a culmination of two particular fetishes - block-based puzzles and explosions - which I absolutely cannot deny.  Now I'm really looking forward to it.
