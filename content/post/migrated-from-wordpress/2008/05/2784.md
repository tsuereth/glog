The obvious thing to be hesitant about in Ninja Gaiden DS is the controls.  A three-dimensional, sword-based brawler on a handheld with a touchscreen?  But as many outlets will tell you, the controls are actually quite remarkable: intuitive, easy to use, well-implemented, and even a little nuanced.

The problem I have with Dragon Sword, based on the <game:Nintendo Channel> demo I played, is that it's sparse - there's not a lot going on.  I fight some ninjas, walk up the stairs, fight more ninjas, fight more ninjas ... fight a dragon, now what?  I wasn't impressed with the depth of gameplay.  Of course it's possible that the demo just isn't showing me how deep it goes, but I'm not willing to pay New Game Price to find out.  Maybe when it's cheaper.
