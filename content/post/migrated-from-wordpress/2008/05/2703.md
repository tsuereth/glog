I tried this out the other day, and the difficulty really took me by surprise.  I was expecting to be able to put on a disguise and waltz through the Sicilian mafioso mansion without much trouble - but the flunkies were able to see through my stolen suit, and started firing.

Now, the cool thing about Hitman is that there's usually some freedom in terms of how much you sneak and how much you shoot.  But I figure I should be good enough to stealth through at least the first mission effectively.  I'll definitely be trying this again, when I have the composure and concentration for it.
