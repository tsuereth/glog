I've been dicking around with GTA4 at a friend's place, and driving into pedestrians and blowing up police cruisers is a shit-ton of fun.  What GTA4 does right is taking the core features of [GTA3](game:Grand Theft Auto III) and enhancing them with stuff like a new physics engine and new AI features.  But what GTA4 gets wrong is that the rest of the game - missions, a storyline, tertiary features - have not evolved at all.  Some have <i>de</i>-volved, in fact.  Crap like watchable TV channels sound nice on paper, but in a video game it's really just a waste of resources.

I'll probably pick it up when I snag a 360 of my own, but it's not enough to sell the system for me.
