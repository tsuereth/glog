This came with my Orange Box for ... some ... reason.  The backgrounds and some flavor graphics and sound bits have been taken from Valve's closet, but the gameplay is - as far as I understand - the same as traditional "[Peggle](game:Peggle Extreme)," whatever the hell that is.  It's a PopCap game, and you should pretty much know what to expect from it.
