My anticipation for Force Unleashed still simmers, although now some condensation of doubt is beginning to trickle down my over-extended metaphor.  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/3067.html">Recent videos</a> have shown quite a bit of the game's combat, and though there are definitely some very cool parts of it, I am struck by two distinct negatives as well - namely, the hordes of brainless enemies, and the lack of gore or dismemberment.

I, along with I'm sure countless other nerds who grew up with Star Wars, have always wanted a Star Wars game that both pushed traditional gameplay formulas (rather than rehashing an existing template "in space") and allowed me to be a total badass with a lightsaber.  With its heavy promotion and dark motif, I was kind of hoping Force Unleashed would be that game; but now I'm not so sure.  Of course this doesn't mean it won't be <i>fun</i>.  Really I just want to lop off Stormtroopers' arms.  Is that such a bad thing?
