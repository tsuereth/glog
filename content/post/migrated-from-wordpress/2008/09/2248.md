I feel like something's wrong with me.  I <i>am</i> a nerd, for fuck's sake, I write <i>embedded firmware</i> for my video game money.  And yet, when I try KOTOR, it just turns me off.  It's just like what happened when I tried <game:Fallout>.  I can stand character customization - I can take deep, involved stories and settings - but when a game's action is slow, even if it works on a deep foundation, I simply can't get into it.  Hell, even <game:Mass Effect>, which is more shooter than RPG, couldn't keep my interest for long.  Am I broken?  Or are these games really boring as hell?
