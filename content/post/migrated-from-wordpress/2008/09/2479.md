Ultra-weird - Namco's putting out <a href="http://kotaku.com/5050395/anime-cutscenes-vs-cg-cutsences-+-fight">two versions</a> of Tales of Hearts, with identical gameplay and everything, just that one has cutscenes in 3D-rendered CGI and the other in a Production IG-drawn anime style.  I'm not really sure <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/39660.html">which</a> <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/39643.html">one</a> looks better, but it's strange at any rate.
