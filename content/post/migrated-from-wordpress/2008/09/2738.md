Yeah, the main game tends to be fairly easy.  There are a handful of head-scratchers, mostly in the final level, but the story mode functions primarily as a showcase and testbed for the super-cool portal technology (and great writing).  As a concept, it's neat and fun to play around with for a while, which is why it's cool that the game's short.

It's also cool that there are bonus rooms, because they <i>really</i> stretch the difficulty of the game.  Maybe too much, in fact.  I did three of the advanced maps and have been met with significant frustration in the others - and the challenge maps (completing a level in a minimal number of portals, or number of steps, or amount of time) present a gargantuan challenge that I am not quite ready to embark upon.  I'll probably come back to these sometime when I'm bored, because the completion of this package is pretty enticing.  Just the same, for the moment I'm satisfied as-is.
