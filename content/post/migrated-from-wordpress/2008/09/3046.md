I've been reading interesting stuff, and watching cool footage, for Lock's Quest since a while back: a two-phase action/strategy game where you first build defenses, and then take part in the battle.  Following 5th Cell's {{% game "Drawn to Life" %}}Drawn to Life{{% /game %}}, I was understandably apprehensive toward Lock's Quest; but after trying the downloadable {{% game "Nintendo Channel" %}}Nintendo Channel{{% /game %}} demo - despite the intro battle dragging on long enough that I didn't even finish it - I'm pretty much sold.  The art is still meh, the sounds are still dull, and the story is still boring, but this time, the gameplay is genuinely intriguing.

<b>EDIT</b>, years later - it's hard for me to get excited about tower defense, anymore.  And I have no confidence in this game's non-gameplay elements.  No longer anticipating.
