My, how time flies.  Back in ... middle? school I would frequently visit my friend who had and played this game, and be amazed by Tesla coils, and nuke tanks, and time machines and so forth.  Time was, Red Alert kicked shit.  ... in retrospect, strategy games have come a long way since 1996.

The installer barely worked, a testament to Windows XP's ability to work just like Windows 95.  The cinematics were, well, not quite as impressive as <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/6194.html">Red Alert 3's</a>.  In the first campaign mission I barely knew what was going in, though it was all over in three minutes, and in the second mission I wandered around for nearly half an hour until all the Reds on the map were dead.  Then I tried a skirmish, which was uneventful for quite a while, and just as I was nearing the apex of my tech tree the game crashed.  The automated un-installer was of course a joke, not even giving me an error message.

Red Alert did succeed in reminding me how boring the original <game:Command & Conquer> was.  For all the nifty units, it didn't really change the core mechanics of the game much; and I'm thinking Red Alert 3, though tempting me with <a href="http://www.ea.com/redalert/factions-allies.jsp?id=Assault_Destroyer">amphibious warships</a>, <a href="http://www.ea.com/redalert/factions-empire.jsp?id=King_Oni">giant Japanese robots</a> and fucking <i><a href="http://www.ea.com/redalert/factions-soviets.jsp?id=WarBear">bears</a></i>, will similarly leave me unexcited in the warm tepidness of battle.
