I'm sure <i>you</i> already know about the revolutionary and immersive storytelling/presentation of BioShock, as they have been reported and essayed upon since well before the game's release last year.  You may also be familiar with the engaging guns-and-plasmids combat system that unites common shooter mechanics with higher-order ammo and weapon strategy.  Hell, there's even a good chance you know all about the fairly deep genetic customization system, and the neat hacking puzzles.

What you may <i>not</i> know is that I have only recently started to play the game myself, and am suitably impressed by all of the aforementioned features, though somewhat intimidated at the moment by an imposing Big Daddy.  Well I guess you know about that now, too.
