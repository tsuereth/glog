Even though I've barely touched the other half of the game (Free Mode, where it doesn't tell you when you've made a mistake!), I really need to move on from Picross.  It's devilishly addictive and engrossing - since I've started playing, I daydream of tile situations and how to solve them.  It's really creepy.  I need to stop.
