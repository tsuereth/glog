After an extended vacation from the game, I finished up the professor's first level; and though it was what I was most looking forward to, it's the most disappointing of the three.  The professor's core puzzle-solving mechanic is by using and combining items into practical tools, and much of it is just nonsensical.  Pipes and a blowdryer make a leafblower?  Pipes and an extension cord make a ladder?  Atomic toasters are one thing, but too much of his gameplay is randomly bumbling around to see what works.

I've also grown extremely bored of the tedious level design.  I started the next level, another Kurt one, and it barely kept me awake.  The sloppy controls, the repetitive music, and the half-baked design have conspired together to really make me want to put the game away.  So I have.
