There is a <i>lot</i> to do in Vice City.  I'm really impressed by the amount of content here.  I'm also really impressed by how poorly some of it is implemented.  When you've got a game that has so many options, it's inevitable that a bunch of them end up not working too well.  But there is enough good in the game that playing it is still damn fun.
