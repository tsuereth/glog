Everything about BioShock is <i>still awesome</i>.  I'm gaining a bit on the difficulty curve - my cash and ammo assets are consistently near topped off, and even difficult enemies (or hordes of enemies) are pretty easy when I can unload round after round at them - but the challenge is still enough to keep things interesting.  The immersive narrative goes on as the personalities of the major players unravel, although it still doesn't distract from the main action of the game.  And the environments are so intriguing, so engrossing, that even backtracking through Arcadia to collect some items was fun.  1950s radio music never sounded so cool.
