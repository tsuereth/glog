Toki Tori's mind-breaking difficulty is both its strongest asset and its most frustrating failure.  While it's extremely satisfying to wrap up a challenging puzzle, the steep difficulty curve and, later on, extreme complexity of a few puzzles is somewhat discouraging.  I was stuck on one level for almost a month solid, and eventually had to check online for a hint (I was looking at the wrong fish the whole time!).

At the same time, this challenge gives Toki Tori a longevity that its level count would not otherwise allow.  And there's a Hard mode, too, which is really fucking hard!  I've only done one of the Hard levels so far, but I feel like I'll probably come back and try them again at some point, when other games in my queue have become tiresome.
