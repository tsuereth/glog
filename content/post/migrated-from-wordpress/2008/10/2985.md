The fact that this game looks <i>identical</i> to <game:Metroid Prime>'s morph ball mode may not be a good thing for the developers, if Retro Studios is keen on pursuing their pseudo-IP - but it <i>does</i> seem like a good thing for me, because I thought the morph ball mode segments were awesome, and this is basically an entire game made out of it.
