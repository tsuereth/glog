Nintendo Power, Volume 226 (9.0/10):

<i>[...] the modified translation somehow feels less inspired then [sic] the original, and, like in the PlayStation version of the game, there is a brief lag after battles.

Of course, if you've already conquered Chrono Trigger in its previous incarnations, your big question is probably whether the new content makes it worth playing yet again.  The answer: not especially.  The new areas are enjoyable, to be sure, but they're not directly connected to the story, and they focus more on combat than anything else.  The Dimensional Vortex dungeons, in particular, would have benefited from better designs instead of a reliance in large part on recycled maps.  And though the monster-battle arena is a nifty idea, you're more an observer than an active participant.

The rest of the review praises the game heavily, but purely for retaining the greatness of the SNES original.  Ehhhhh...
