Alright, you know what?  Fuck planet Rilgar.  There are two ways to go from the landing site - one to a near-impossible underwater gauntlet that stretches the limits of how fast you can move (without drowning), and another that goes to a series of rooms filled with stupid amounts of enemies that are impossible to survive because of the camera and weapon aim sucking (and the last checkpoint is ten minutes back!).  I'm like a third of the way through the game, this sudden spike in difficulty is not cool.  As much as I'd like to be able to say that I played through R&C to the end, this frustration is not fucking worth it.
