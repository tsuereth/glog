Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the initial announcement of Ōkami on Wii, is a review from <b>Nintendo Power</b> that actually recommends the PS2 version <b>over</b> it.

"So why am I having such a hard time recommending this game?  Quite simply, the controls just didn't make the jump to Wii as well as they should have.  [...] while pointing and drawing [Celestrial Brush techniques] is faster and allows for more freedom than using an analog stick, it's harder to be precise, resulting in the game having a tougher time recognizing your brush strokes.  [...] Slow, timed swipes of the remote are required to score consecutive hits with many weapons [...] And where's the motion-based fishing?  For shame!  [...] Ōkami is a work of genius, but you should play the original game instead of the Wii version if you can." - <i>Chris H.</i>
