It's been a [long time](game:Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III - Rebel Strike) since I played a Star Wars game.  I saw friends play [Bounty Hunter](game:Star Wars: Bounty Hunter); I saw friends play [Jedi Knight II](game:Star Wars: Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast); and I wasn't too upset that I passed on them myself.  I'm not about to argue with the guy who says that Lucasarts lost its touch after the point-and-click adventure titles (usually, that guy is me).

But for some reason, this one feels different.  I mean there's the real-motion lightsaber swinging, but that only applies in a two-player battle mode.  And they say that there's so much going on logistically - AI, physics, particle engines, everything interacting intrinsically - that it's a sort of magical hyperrealism; but we've all heard that song and dance before.  I don't know, maybe it's just the fact that you can [kill people with spaceships]($SiteBaseURL$wp-content/uploads/2008/04/starwars_forceunleashed.jpg), but I've got a good feeling about this one.
