Augh.  I tried playing Devil May Cry last week, and I got two stages in before I got bored and put it down.  The introductory cinematic made me feel like an idiot - Dante fires his dual-handguns at a <i>motorcycle</i> that was <i>thrown at him</i> by a chick in a <i>leather vest</i> - which would be fine if the gameplay was at least compelling, but it really isn't doing it for me.  Totally mindless slashing and gun-firing.  Today I tried stage 3, which put me up against some lava spider boss who completely destroyed me, and I really don't care enough to keep trying.

It's extremely possible that I just haven't gotten to the part of the game that's "fun" yet, and so I'll be coming back to this at some point, but for now I just don't see any merit in it.  Which sucks, because I actually bought it in a {{% game "Devil May Cry 2" %}}three{{% /game %}} {{% game "Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening" %}}pack{{% /game %}}.
