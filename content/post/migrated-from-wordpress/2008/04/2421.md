As I started this game, it was an <i>affront</i> to me.  Everything about it - the weirdly-lit graphics, the quirky sound effects, the one-song "soundtrack," the invisible plot - just rubbed me the wrong way.  It reminded me way too much of {{% game "Vexx" %}}Vexx{{% /game %}}, which is just about the worst thing a video game can do.

As I'm getting further into it, the slightly increased depth of the game has me a little more interested.  But its execution still irks me.  Fortunately, I should be done with it very soon.
