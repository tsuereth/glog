As it turns out, the game's promise of ten chapters included both the prologue and epilogue - a merciful decision for which I am grateful.  At a total finish time of about four hours, I would be super-surprised if the non-interactive, non-interesting cutscenes accounted for anything less than three and a half of them.

In fairness, the remaining, brief actual "gameplay" isn't exactly interesting itself (in fact, I hesitate to call it interactive, either).  The game has a multitude of not-compellingly-different endings, which is a bit like saying that Nazis killed Jews in several different ways; the variety doesn't really make it any better.

And for good measure - the plot was retarded.
