I happened to be able to play the original [Bangai-O](game:Bangai-O Spirits) a while back, and it's really an amazing game - controlled on two axes (ala [Robotron](game:Robotron: 2084)), Bangai-O combines goofball Japanese themes and Treasure's infamous knack for high-octane shooters.  When I heard they were making a new one for the DS (with wireless multiplayer!  and a level editor!) I was beside myself.  But! I recently learned that Spirits has <i>removed</i> the second axis; you can only fire in the direction you move.  It may seem like a small change, but the two-axis dynamic was a key part of the old game, and now I'm a bit wary about this new one ... but I'll still give it a look.
