Luigi's Mansion has all the traits and trappings of a bad game, and it would be wrong of me to call it anything else.

After the first area, the game becomes difficult by means of annoyance - trying to fend off multiple enemies at once is impossible; new rooms in the mansion take forever to get between; ghosts have to be followed once, twice, <b>twenty times</b> as they move from room to room and back again.  My primary hardship with the final boss was because the boss himself <i>obstructed my view</i>, and I had no idea what the fuck was going on.  The game is insultingly short at only a few hours, but to be honest I was still relieved to be done with the thing.

Not only is Luigi's Mansion missing polish, it's missing content.  It's missing engagement.  It's missing <i>fun</i>.  Really, the only thing it does right is show off a new generation of graphical tricks, and trying to package it as a game was a mistake.

I feel for you, Luigi.  I really do.  Here's hoping you do better next time.
