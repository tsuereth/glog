After something of a hiatus, I came back to Drawn to Life to see if maybe I just didn't get it.  Suffering through a terribly boring platforming stage was enough to convince me I still don't.  And then there was story crap going on in the town!... I don't think I've ever played a game that felt so much like a chore.  Everything is insipidly easy, but takes way too long, and is infested with sickeningly cute characters and just plain sickening music.  Platforming formula basics like <i>jumping</i> and <i>the viewport</i> are handled poorly, and the level design is really no more than a lengthy sequence of 20-year-old platform constructs.

I'll say it again - if you just want to doodle, this might be your cup of tea, but I hesitate to call this a "game" in any real capacity.
