I haven't started the game up yet, but the manual offers some interesting tidbits:

* The game's "puzzle master" (the designer of all the game's puzzles), Akira Tago, is a professor emeritus at Chiba University, and a best-selling puzzle book author in Japan
* Professor Layton's hotel room can be feng shui-ed with items you earn in the game, and when his Happiness meter fills up, "something good will happen!"
* New puzzles can be downloaded <i>weekly</i> from Nintendo WFC
* There is a secret in the game that can only be unlocked with a password from [the sequel](game:Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box)'s manual

Awesome!
