I haven't started the game up yet, but the manual offers some interesting tidbits:

<ul>
<li>The game's "puzzle master" (the designer of all the game's puzzles), Akira Tago, is a professor emeritus at Chiba University, and a best-selling puzzle book author in Japan</li>
<li>Professor Layton's hotel room can be feng shui-ed with items you earn in the game, and when his Happiness meter fills up, "something good will happen!"</li>
<li>New puzzles can be downloaded <i>weekly</i> from Nintendo WFC</li>
<li>There is a secret in the game that can only be unlocked with a password from {{% game "Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box" %}}the sequel{{% /game %}}'s manual</li>
</ul>

Awesome!
