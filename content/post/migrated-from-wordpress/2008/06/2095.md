On the one hand, I would never voluntarily do any sort of fitness or exercise activity if it wasn't play-monetized as it is in Wii Fit.  I know it's not exactly the same as a gym membership, but when I'm staring at the TV and holding a Wiimote, twisting myself around like an idiot doesn't feel so bad.

On the other hand, I'm not totally sure about the effectiveness or accuracy of the game for practical exercise.  Since I started playing (which, so far, has consisted just of doing my Body Test) I've allegedly gained weight at a somewhat alarming pace.  I have trouble believing that I actually gained five pounds between yesterday morning and yesterday evening.

So, it's kinda fun, and I think I am getting at least something out of it in terms of general fitness.  But I am as-yet unconvinced that it is capable of transforming me into a healthy person.
