I tried playing [Vice City](game:Grand Theft Auto: Vice City) again recently, and it really served to reinforce my feelings about GTA4's progress.  While it is basically the same game as before, it <i>has</i> succeeded in fixing and polishing a great deal of the franchise's issues.  Going back, I found myself missing a lot - the improved map functionality, camera controls, dumbed-down police AI, not losing all my weapons after being blown up, etc.

At the same time though, it's easy to pick out things wrong in GTA4 as well: a lot of the freelance missions are gone (ambulances and fire trucks); you still lose stuff when you get busted; the limited number of weapons you can use from inside a car... in general, while I wouldn't say it's "as bad as" Madden, I feel a similar sort of effect, in that installment after installment is just slowly and incrementally working on the same formula, in a way that ensures leaving room for improvement in the next game.

Of course, unlike Madden, I find the GTA formula absolutely fun as hell.  So I guess it's not too terrible that each game is just better than the one before it, and not necessarily as good as it could be.
