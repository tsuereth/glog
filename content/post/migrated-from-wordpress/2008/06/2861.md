Take your everyday platform-puzzler - trying to get a little guy through a maze of obstacles and enemies toward some goal(s) - and add wacky sound effects, shiny graphics, and super-cool items, and you're looking at Toki Tori.

The puzzles are pretty good so far (having completed the first of four(?) worlds, each of which I guess has 10 levels), and the nifty point-and-pathfind remote control scheme works surprisingly well, but by far the coolest part of Toki Tori is the item system.  The first item in the game is a bridge, which you can build to cross small gaps.  The second item is a <i>teleporter</i>, which you can use to instantly move two spaces in a given direction.  The third item is an <i>ice gun</i> to freeze enemies.  I can only assume the items will continue to become even more awesome at a ridiculous pace.
