Valiant Hearts really feels like it does "good enough" on all fronts.  Despite occasional frustrations with pixel-hunting or unclear objectives, the adventure-style gameplay is solid and engaging.  Despite the relatively generic characters, they manage to eke out some emotional moments toward the end.  And despite both of the aforementioned angles, the game also manages to present powerful and educational insights into what it was like to live during - or through - World War I.

It isn't a revolutionary triumph, but Valiant Hearts accomplishes an admirable amount for what it is.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Broken Age> (Chapter 1, anyway)  
<b>If it helps, might be worth mentioning</b>: That there are a handful of pseudo-runner, obstacle-dodging stages set to era-appropriate war and marching music.
