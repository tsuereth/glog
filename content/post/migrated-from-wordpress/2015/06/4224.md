During the first couple minutes of <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/16/uncharted-4-gameplay-debuts-at-e3-2015/">this crazy footage</a>, all I could think about was how frustrating playing as Nathan Drake usually is, i.e., that the guy playing the shootout couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.  Of course, when your core gameplay is suboptimal to control and poorly balanced, the natural thing to do is add whole-new mechanics like driving a truck through a hilly village.  I shudder to think of the probable instantaneous mission-failures when hitting a pedestrian, or when not presciently making the correct turn down a blind dirt alley.

But it's all moot anyway.  I'm buying and playing this for the Sully-Drake banter.  Naughty Dog could replace the gameplay sequences with a bunch of {{% game "God of War" %}}God of War{{% /game %}} quick-time events and I'd still suffer through it.
