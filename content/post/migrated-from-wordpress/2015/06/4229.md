The last [Transformers game](game:Transformers: War for Cybertron) I played failed to impress me.  It was okay, I guess.  Actually, now that I'm looking back, I very specifically said that I preferred <game:Vanquish>'s brand of high-octane robotic action.

So if the guys who made Vanquish want to make a <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/17/take-a-look-at-platinums-transformers-devastation/">crazy fighting transforming robot game</a> of their own, then, yeah.  I could get pretty interested in that.
