As surprising as it was to <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/16/the-last-guardian-launching-in-2016/">see anything</a> about The Last Guardian, let alone that it still resembles what was shown six years ago, let further alone that there's a formal release date (which, you know, I'll still reserve some doubt for); what astonishes me the most about this trailer is that, between the weird visual effects and visibly-awkward controls, it legitimately looks like the same kind of game that Ueda-san was making in [2001](game:Ico).
