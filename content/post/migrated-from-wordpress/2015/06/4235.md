I've been watching No Man's Sky's red-tinted spacefaring trailers for <i>a year and a half</i>, and <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/17/no-mans-sky-confirmed-for-pc-e3-2015/">this one</a> is the first that actually tantalizes me with substantive content.

Exploration is cool and all, but flying around and looking at stuff is an incomplete design.  Show me more tense action, and more in the way of goals and objectives, and I might be able to think of No Man's Sky as more than just a pretty, infinitely-generated boredomscape.
