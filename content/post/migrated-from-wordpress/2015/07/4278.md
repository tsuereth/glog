Arkham Knight looks gorgeous running at 60 frames per second.  It's a shame that <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/208650/discussions/0/523890046877777522/">the game doesn't work</a> at that speed.

But aside from the easy target of Arkham Knight's technical infidelity - which, by the way: I had to restart the Riddler boss fight because he got stuck in an AI loop - it's just as disappointing that the game's most lackluster sidequest is also its largest and most time-consuming.  The Riddler's collectible bullshit accounts for almost half of my total playing time.

While I can admire the cleverness of many of the Riddler's puzzles, the sheer amount of them makes dealing with him more tedious and annoying than anything.  Which, I guess, actually fits The Riddler's character rather well.
