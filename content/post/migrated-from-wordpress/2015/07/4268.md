Ronin lacks the <i>precision</i> of its primary inspirations, {{% game "Gunpoint" %}}Gunpoint{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Mark of the Ninja" %}}Mark of the Ninja{{% /game %}}.  Gunpoint was able to avoid ambiguities in general by making all combat (and other interactions) instantaneous: You won, or you died; while encounters in Ronin must be split into several "turns" of action to evade and murder numerous enemies.  Mark of the Ninja used highly-polished mechanics to very clearly indicate enemy awareness and action ranges; Ronin's tools for these are just not as comprehensive.

What Ronin does have, however, is a great assembly of some of the awesomest parts of those two games.  Grapple through a pane of glass to "infiltrate" a building, then slash a guard up with your sword.  Flit past incoming gunfire, then leap into a dude to knock him out, setting up the kill.

The demo doesn't show very many gameplay devices - just "hacking" (clicking on) computer terminals for information, and jumping-and-swording combat sessions - but it's enough.  Despite not being as polished as some of its contemporaries, Ronin is damned entertaining.  I'd be up for more of this.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
