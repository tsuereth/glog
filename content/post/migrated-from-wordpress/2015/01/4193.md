First, the bad news:

* There's no local co-op.
* It still looks like a Wii game (the only graphics options are resolution and antialiasing on/off).

But the good news is:

* This is the same hilariously-outlandish story from {{% game "The House of the Dead: Overkill" %}}The House of the Dead: Overkill{{% /game %}}, but with, uh, <i>typing</i>.
* There's practically no penalty for death, with infinite continues that just lower the score a little bit.
* And the original (shooting) game is <i>included</i> as an extra mode.  (I haven't tried it out with a Wii-remote Bluetooth hookup yet, but it should work?)

Typing out vulgar words and phrases while the game's characters bicker with one another is at least as fun as the original rail-shooter was.  And as an accomplished typist, I was actually given a pretty good run for my money on the game's default difficulty level.

This game will almost certainly reappear at some drunken gatherings in my future.

<i>Progress: Finished on Agent difficulty.</i>
