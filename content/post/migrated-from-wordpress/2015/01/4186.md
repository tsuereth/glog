A running theme for games in 2014 was that of <i>disappointment</i>, from "mild" all the way to "crushing."  {{% game "Watch Dogs" %}}Watch Dogs{{% /game %}} was <a href="http://games.on.net/2014/06/ubisoft-game-the-review/">formulaic</a> (and <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/28/watch-dogs-pc-ultra-e3-2012-demo-video-compared/">literally lackluster</a>), {{% game "Assassin's Creed Unity" %}}Assassin's Creed Unity{{% /game %}} released as <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-performance-issues-reported-on-all-platforms/">hot garbage</a>, {{% game "Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth" %}}Civilization: Beyond Earth{{% /game %}}'s "beyond" was <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth/user-reviews">questionable</a>, the mobile remake of {{% game "Final Fantasy VI" %}}Final Fantasy VI{{% /game %}} looked <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFVI">godawful</a> -- and outside my own sphere of interest, there's word on the street about {{% game "Titanfall" %}}Titanfall{{% /game %}}'s <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/titanfall/user-reviews">lacking content</a>, {{% game "Destiny" %}}Destiny{{% /game %}}'s <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/destiny/user-reviews">unexpected grind</a>, {{% game "Halo: The Master Chief Collection" %}}Halo: The Master Chief Collection{{% /game %}}'s <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/25/halo-the-master-chief-collection-developer-we-will-make-this-right-with-our-fans/">broken internets</a>, and {{% game "Driveclub" %}}Driveclub{{% /game %}}'s <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/18/drveclub-server-issues-os4-shawn-layden-cant-effectively-test/">fucked-upedness</a>.  {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Batman: Arkham Knight{{% /game %}} got <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/08/batman-arkham-knight-release-date-revealed-coming-june-2015/">delayed</a>, {{% game "The Witness (2016)" %}}The Witness{{% /game %}} got <i>silently</i> delayed, {{% game "Grand Theft Auto V" %}}Grand Theft Auto V{{% /game %}} on PC <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52308/grand-theft-auto-v-release-dates-and-exclusive-content">still isn't out</a>, the follow-up to {{% game "Sleeping Dogs" %}}Sleeping Dogs{{% /game %}} seems <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/23/sleeping-dogs-follow-up-triad-wars-gets-first-trailer-beta-registration-open-now/">totally stupid</a>, and {{% game "Rise of the Tomb Raider" %}}Rise of the Tomb Raider{{% /game %}} appears to induce <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/12/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-microsoft-deal-does-have-a-duration-square-enix-reiterates/">executive mouth-diarrhea</a>.  Double Fine just <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/30/broken-age-episode-2-expected-in-early-2015/">stopped</a> <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/22/spacebase-df-9-development-cease-tim-schafer-response/">trying</a>.  Sonic Boom ({{% game "Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric" %}}Wii U{{% /game %}}/{{% game "Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal" %}}3DS{{% /game %}}) was <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii-u/sonic-boom-rise-of-lyric">way</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/sonic-boom-shattered-crystal">worse</a> than anyone could have expected, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-x-cyclesonic-cycle">some-crazy-how</a>.  And then there's {{% game "The Last Guardian" %}}The Last Guardian{{% /game %}}, which just ... <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/12/10/the-last-guardian-ps4-ueda-new-conditions/"><i>come on</i>, guys</a>.

But I would recommend forgetting all that.  Neglecting those shortfalls and faceplants, 2014 had a lot of good in it.  {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor" %}}Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor{{% /game %}} launched with only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/10/08/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-paid-branding-deals-should-have-gamergate-up-in-arms/">a minor hitch</a>.  {{% game "Diablo III" %}}Diablo III{{% /game %}} became legitimately fun.  The {{% game "BioShock" %}}BioShock{{% /game %}} saga came {{% game "BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 2" %}}satisfyingly full-circle{{% /game %}}.  {{% game "Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney" %}}Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney{{% /game %}} <i>wasn't</i> a disaster.  The {{% platform "Wii U" %}}Wii U{{% /platform %}} finally has a library worth crowing about, with 2013's {{% game "Super Mario 3D World" %}}Super Mario 3D World{{% /game %}} complemented by {{% game "Mario Kart 8" %}}Mario Kart 8{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Hyrule Warriors" %}}Hyrule Warriors{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U" %}}Super Smash Bros. for Wii U{{% /game %}}, and <b>of course</b> {{% game "Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker" %}}Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker{{% /game %}}.  And {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D" %}}The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D{{% /game %}} is coming, I mean, it was <i>always</i> coming, but it's <i>imminent</i> now.  That moon could crash down at any moment.

Being a gamer is as good as it's ever been.  Even if I'm still waiting on practically all of my Kickstarter games.
