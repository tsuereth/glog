A running theme for games in 2014 was that of <i>disappointment</i>, from "mild" all the way to "crushing."  <game:Watch Dogs> was <a href="http://games.on.net/2014/06/ubisoft-game-the-review/">formulaic</a> (and <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/28/watch-dogs-pc-ultra-e3-2012-demo-video-compared/">literally lackluster</a>), <game:Assassin's Creed Unity> released as <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-performance-issues-reported-on-all-platforms/">hot garbage</a>, [Civilization: Beyond Earth](game:Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth)'s "beyond" was <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth/user-reviews">questionable</a>, the mobile remake of <game:Final Fantasy VI> looked <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFVI">godawful</a> -- and outside my own sphere of interest, there's word on the street about <game:Titanfall>'s <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/titanfall/user-reviews">lacking content</a>, <game:Destiny>'s <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/destiny/user-reviews">unexpected grind</a>, <game:Halo: The Master Chief Collection>'s <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/25/halo-the-master-chief-collection-developer-we-will-make-this-right-with-our-fans/">broken internets</a>, and <game:Driveclub>'s <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/18/drveclub-server-issues-os4-shawn-layden-cant-effectively-test/">fucked-upedness</a>.  <game:Batman: Arkham Knight> got <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/08/batman-arkham-knight-release-date-revealed-coming-june-2015/">delayed</a>, [The Witness](game:The Witness (2016)) got <i>silently</i> delayed, <game:Grand Theft Auto V> on PC <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52308/grand-theft-auto-v-release-dates-and-exclusive-content">still isn't out</a>, the follow-up to <game:Sleeping Dogs> seems <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/23/sleeping-dogs-follow-up-triad-wars-gets-first-trailer-beta-registration-open-now/">totally stupid</a>, and <game:Rise of the Tomb Raider> appears to induce <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/12/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-microsoft-deal-does-have-a-duration-square-enix-reiterates/">executive mouth-diarrhea</a>.  Double Fine just <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/30/broken-age-episode-2-expected-in-early-2015/">stopped</a> <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/22/spacebase-df-9-development-cease-tim-schafer-response/">trying</a>.  Sonic Boom ([Wii U](game:Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric)/[3DS](game:Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal)) was <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii-u/sonic-boom-rise-of-lyric">way</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/sonic-boom-shattered-crystal">worse</a> than anyone could have expected, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-x-cyclesonic-cycle">some-crazy-how</a>.  And then there's <game:The Last Guardian>, which just ... <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/12/10/the-last-guardian-ps4-ueda-new-conditions/"><i>come on</i>, guys</a>.

But I would recommend forgetting all that.  Neglecting those shortfalls and faceplants, 2014 had a lot of good in it.  <game:Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor> launched with only <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/10/08/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-paid-branding-deals-should-have-gamergate-up-in-arms/">a minor hitch</a>.  <game:Diablo III> became legitimately fun.  The <game:BioShock> saga came [satisfyingly full-circle](game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 2).  <game:Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney> <i>wasn't</i> a disaster.  The [Wii U](platform:WiiU) finally has a library worth crowing about, with 2013's <game:Super Mario 3D World> complemented by <game:Mario Kart 8>, <game:Hyrule Warriors>, <game:Super Smash Bros. for Wii U>, and <b>of course</b> <game:Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker>.  And <game:The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D> is coming, I mean, it was <i>always</i> coming, but it's <i>imminent</i> now.  That moon could crash down at any moment.

Being a gamer is as good as it's ever been.  Even if I'm still waiting on practically all of my Kickstarter games.
