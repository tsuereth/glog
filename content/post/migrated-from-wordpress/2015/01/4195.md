I've got plenty of challenges left, and I think they are going to stay that way.  I don't have enough interest left in them to bang my head against the Cruel Smash challenges ... or to suffer through more games of Smash Tour.  Though I'm sure this will be a couch co-op staple for months to come, my solo exploits in Smash 4 are probably over.

<i>Progress: 76/140 challenges complete, 228 trophies, finished all Solo Events on Normal.</i>
