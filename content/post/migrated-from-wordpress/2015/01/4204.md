So it's smaller and shorter than a full Saints Row excursion.  So the architecture is still reminiscent of <game:Saints Row IV> (and even [The Third](game:Saints Row: The Third)).  So the story is ham-handed and awkward.  So Jay Mohr phoned in his voice work.

So what?  It's more open-world exploration, more wacky-weapon mayhem, and more absurd humor.  It's more Saints Row.  I'm okay with that.
