As game collections go, you could certainly do worse.

<b>Aether</b> is a charming little game; there isn't a lot to it, but it's a fun experience everyone should try.  To be honest, I didn't get totally sucked in by its childlike wonder, but only because I was so enchanted by the original Flash version (back in twenty-aught-eight) that I <i>still</i> remember all the puzzle solutions.

<b>Spewer</b> is a neat puzzle concept (filling rooms with liquid that you can imbibe and regurgitate at will), but I'm already getting to a point where the required platforming precision is a bit much for me.

<b>Time Fcuk</b> is, well, surprising!  I'm barely into it so far, but the way it mixes up mechanics, and provides running, paradoxical commentary is very cool.

More on the others as they develop.
