In my continuing effort to verify once and for all whether [Uncharted 2](game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves) is better than Uncharted 3, I started replaying this guy again -- and so far I'm not totally sure yet.

I'm about halfway through, so I haven't done the cool sinking ship part or the desert stuff yet, but <i>man</i>, the early parts of this game are disjointed.  From Colombia to London, to France, and Syria, and now Yemen, the scene changes are just <i>too much</i>.  As with the disoriented timeline of its predecessor, Uncharted 3's storytelling seems like it has most of the right pieces, just not always in the right sequence.

And I'm already getting sick to death of having to fight dozens of fuckin' pirates all in one go, especially when they've got sniper rifles, combat shotguns, machine turrets, and body armor that seems to be made of <i>adamantium</i>.

I know the best is ahead of me, so I can't say for sure; but this is lending more weight to my theory that remembering Uncharted is more fun than playing it.
