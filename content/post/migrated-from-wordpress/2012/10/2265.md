So far, Captain Scarlett is more of the same from <game:Borderlands 2>, which is a very good thing.  I saved a town, which turned out to be inhabited by one extra-creepy dude, from a bunch of pirates, who throw exploding bottles of rum.  And I just got my sand skiff, which is like some kind of awesome jet powered hovercraft with harpoons and rockets.

So yeah!  Badass.

<i>Progress: Repaired the sand skiff!</i>
