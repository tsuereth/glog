While I had (and still have) an endless admiration for [Lords of Shadow](game:Castlevania: Lords of Shadow)'s production values, the game itself never really gripped me.  Now I find myself questioning that -- because this sequel, in which you are apparently Vlad himself, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/01/konami-officially-announces-castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/">looks way too fucking cool</a>.  Granted, the cinematic doesn't prove that playing as Dracula will actually be any fun, but <i>how couldn't it be?</i>
