Of the <game:Saints Row: The Third> main DLC trilogy - [Genkibowl VII](game:Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII), this guy, and [The Trouble with Clones](game:Saints Row: The Third - The Trouble with Clones) - this is the one I was most looking forward to, for obvious reasons: aliens, lasers, and spaceships.  Right!?  As it turns out, the DLC is themed completely around making a <i>movie</i>, so there aren't real aliens, and the lasers and spaceships seem a bit out-of-place.  They are cool, but nevertheless, the whole sci-fi parody premise feels more forced than funny.

Parts of the DLC's mini-campaign feel a bit overlong -- even though the whole package is still quite short.  You do have the opportunity of replaying the series of missions once you're done, although why you would want to is anyone's guess.  And the spaceship?  Not as fun to fly as the VTOL aircraft from the main game.

Not really worth $7, but as part of its <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/901805/">three-pack</a> - itself at a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/8108/">substantial discount</a> - not a bad deal.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII>  
<b>So has Volition learned to make meaningful DLC yet?</b>: still nope.
