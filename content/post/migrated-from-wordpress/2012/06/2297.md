My interest in this was pretty lukewarm, on the assumption that shoehorning the "True Crime" (whatever that means) out of the existing production would only exacerbate what Activision saw as <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/01/square-enix-snags-rights-to-true-crime-hong-kong-from-activisio/">quality issues</a>.  But as the hype train starts to roll up, it's becoming evident that this game is <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/05/25/meet-hong-kongs-yaku-er-triads-in-the-latest-sleeping-dogs/">packed to the gills</a> with the kinds of things I love from, maybe not Grand Theft Auto, but possibly Saints Row.  Also, apparently the "True Crime" thing <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/06/the-true-story-of-sleeping-dogs-non-true-crime-origins/">wasn't even</a>, which is even more comforting, somehow.
