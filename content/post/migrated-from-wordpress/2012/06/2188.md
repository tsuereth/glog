In <game:Diablo II>, the Nightmare and Hell difficulty levels were <a href="http://www.diablowiki.com/Difficulty_(Diablo_II)">completely fucking retarded</a>, with reduced (as in negative) magic resistance and sweeping enemy immunities -- designed explicitly to make you weak and totally helpless.  Comparatively, Diablo III has much more approachable difficulties, especially since - at least in Nightmare - level-ups continue to scale fairly well.  But it's still just unfair enough to feel frustrating.

New elite-monster modifications start to appear - like Arcane Enchanted, which turns a battle into a deadly Pink Floyd show, and Fire Chains, which seemed silly until two fast-moving imps ran jumpropes of fiery death around me - and certain combinations, like Jailer (rooting me in one place) and Plagued or Defiler (placing devastating but usually-avoidable damage sources in one place) just feel game-breaking.  Meanwhile, while the equipment drops are generally better, they're not better <i>enough</i> to scale with the game difficulty, and there is an increasingly depressing sense of Blizzard driving me to the Auction House just to keep pace.

I had fun with each of the game's classes through Normal mode, and I'm sure that, as with [StarCraft II](game:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty), I'll be picking this back up every now and then to screw around with my buddies.  But I think I'm done trying to climb the Nightmare/Hell/Inferno ladder.
