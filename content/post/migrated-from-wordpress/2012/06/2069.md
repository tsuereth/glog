Tomb Raider is one of the last franchises I expected to be giving half a shit about (the surprisingly pleasant [Guardian of Light](game:Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light) spinoff notwithstanding).  Naughty Dog made it clear that they had no problem carrying that torch for themselves.  But the most recent media for <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/01/tomb-raider-explores-retail-on-march-5-2013/">Lara's new adventure</a> shows plainly that her keepers have been watching Drake closely, and taking notes.  Deep characterization, an immediately intriguing plot, and high-octane set pieces are all accounted for here.  Hey, if this Tomb Raider can be <i>as</i> good as an Uncharted, that's plenty good enough.
