So {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII" %}}Genkibowl VII{{% /game %}} was fun, if shallow, and {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space" %}}Gangstas in Space{{% /game %}} was generally underwhelming.  The Trouble with Clones has more in common with the latter than the former - wholly encapsulated in its mini-campaign, with scant replay value - but stands out for a pleasantly witty story (narrated by a comic book nerd), and a legitimately awesome play mechanic in the accelerated Saints Flow energy drink: it turns you into a superhero.

When you can run at the speed of traffic, punch enemies so hard they explode (complete with "BIFF" and "ZAM" starburst effects), and launch fireballs at freakin' helicopters, the second half of this DLC's mini-campaign feels like a hilarious and well-realized addition to Saints Row's established irreverence.  But it's still disappointingly brief and throw-away, especially in that the resurrected, monstrous Johnny Gat doesn't have a bigger role.

Not really worth $7, but as part of its <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/901805/">three-pack</a> - itself at a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/8108/">substantial discount</a> - not a bad deal.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space" %}}Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII" %}}Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII{{% /game %}}  
<b>So has Volition learned to make meaningful DLC yet?</b>: definitely nope.
