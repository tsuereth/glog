My first thoughts were, is this <b>really</b> just some <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3:_Extended_Cut">additional dialog and cutscenes</a>?  These were my second thoughts, also.  My third thoughts were, do I really need to play through the whole ending sequence again to see this new stuff, hidden in the old stuff?  And then my fourth thoughts were a lot like the first two.

Eventually, I reached the part where the Catalyst explains stuff, and I do appreciate that it <i>actually explained something</i> this time around.  The new ending?  Nice to have a choice, but the content is pretty meh.  And I honestly didn't care enough to even watch the rest of the new stuff.

At any rate, I hope that future generations of <game:Mass Effect 3> player will enjoy this less-retarded conclusion.  It's a good thing the DLC was free, though, because it really didn't do anything for me.
