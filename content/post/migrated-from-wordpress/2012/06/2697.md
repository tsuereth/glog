At first blush, Genkibowl VII appears to be the least interesting of {{% game "Saints Row: The Third" %}}Saints Row: The Third{{% /game %}}'s big-ticket DLC trilogy (along with {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space" %}}Gangstas in Space{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - The Trouble with Clones" %}}The Trouble with Clones{{% /game %}}).  But, like SR3 itself, Genkibowl is perfectly willing to sacrifice integrity and wit for the sake of pure, stupid fun.  In this DLC pack you'll drive into pedestrians to please Professor Genki; you'll go through an amped-up version of the Prof's obstacle courses from the main game; and you'll play a destructive mini-game with a giant ball of yarn, blowing up rival mascots.

Beyond the DLC's snack-sized campaign, the obstacle course and yarn-ball events have standalone versions that can be done just for fun, plus extra vehicles and so on.  But the content as a whole is pretty brief -- and yeah, doesn't have much thematic cohesion.

Not really worth $7, but as part of its <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/901805/">three-pack</a> - itself at a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/8108/">substantial discount</a> - not a bad deal.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Red Faction: Armageddon - Path to War" %}}Red Faction: Armageddon - Path to War{{% /game %}}  
<b>So has Volition learned to make meaningful DLC yet?</b>: nope!
