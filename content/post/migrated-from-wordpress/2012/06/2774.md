I'd be lying if I said the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/04/splinter-cell-blacklist-revealed-for-xbox/">run-and-gun mark-and-execute action</a> didn't excite me -- if it all actually works, this fluid shooting dynamic could be pretty excellent.  But given my experience with [Conviction](game:Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction), I'll want some more assurances about the "actually works" part.
