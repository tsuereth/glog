Honestly?  I dunno about this one yet.  Uncharted is an easy sell for its Indiana Jones adventuring and its Hollywood flair -- <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/04/the-last-of-us-e3-demo-video-is-brutal-bloody/">this beast</a> is darker and more tortured, and at the same time presents the kind of resource-limited gameplay scenarios that I just find frustrating.

I'll be keeping my eyes open, though.
