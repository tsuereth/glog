Well, I've heard that this DLC <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/batman-arkham-city---harley-quinns-revenge">isn't all that</a>, but I want to find out for myself and I've got $10 to waste.  Unfortunately, the already-convoluted purchase process - in which I bought it on Steam, but apparently must redeem my code in Games for Windows Live? - has failed me, because my code <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2739805">doesn't</a> <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2739875">work</a>.

Not off to a great start here, guys.
