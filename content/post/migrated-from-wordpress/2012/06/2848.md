My key suddenly started working again yesterday, so I was able to put some time into Harley Quinn's Revenge -- <i>very little</i> time, considering the DLC is so brief.  It's not bad, per se; like [The Missing Link](game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link), it offers a microcosm of most of what made the main game special and fun.  The writing and pacing are excellent, and the combat and puzzle density is fantastic.

But I have to re-emphasize that this mini-campaign is <b>short</b>.  And during its brief life, there are no open-world, freeform components, nor does Robin play differently enough from Batman to make his segments feel special.

Harley Quinn's Revenge is fun and well-produced, but not vital to the [Arkham City](game:Batman: Arkham City) experience and maybe a little overpriced.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Red Faction: Armageddon - Path to War>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link>  
<b>For the record</b>: buying a Games for Windows Live key through Steam is still some <i>bull</i>shit

<i>Progress: Complete</i>
