This is an <i>art game</i>, if that wasn't exceedingly obvious from the get-go.  That being said, it isn't a complete waste: the writing is clever and mildly amusing, the aesthetic theme is intriguing, and the "gameplay" is -- yeah, alright, time to get real.  It's pleasantly simple at first, but Sworcery rather quickly demonstrates that - depite being self-aware as a mobile game, by chopping its campaign up into bite-sized chunks - it has some difficulty grasping the concept of playability.

To wit, it makes the classic adventure-game gaffe of blocking puzzle solutions until you've walked back and forth to gather the proper dialog; it forcibly draws out story sequences to revel in its own ponderous animations; and in the boss fight of the second chapter, I kept getting hit by an instant-kill attack, <i>several minutes</i> into the fight, forcing me to start the entire thing over again.

These aren't necessarily horrendous mistakes, but what lies underneath just isn't interesting enough to merit wading through them.  Summarily: not worth it.
