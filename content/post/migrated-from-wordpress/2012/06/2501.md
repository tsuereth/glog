Arkane Studios doesn't really have much of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkane_Studios">track record</a>, which makes the ambition and <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/01/dishonored-trailer-offers-first-look-at-gameplay/">sheer cool-factor</a> of Dishonored that much more amazing.  If the game can really deliver on the kind of open-endedness that it <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/06/dishonored-e3-2012/">intends</a>, and if its world can maintain the visual richness and nuance of the trailers so far, these guys could really give [Irrational](game:BioShock Infinite) a run for their money.
