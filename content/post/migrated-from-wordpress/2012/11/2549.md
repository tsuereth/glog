Stacking takes a pretty interesting approach to its puzzles: for the main story's objectives, and secondary "challenges," there are always multiple solutions (anywhere from three to six) -- any one solution being good enough to proceed.  While some of them are esoteric and obtuse, each challenge has at least one solution that's relatively easy or intuitive.  So the game as a whole is a fairly smooth experience, with the more trying solutions available for players who want more.

Each of the game's levels - four plus a special ending sequence, and a whole additional level in the included "Lost Hobo King" DLC - oozes personality and charmingly-designed stacking doll characters.  It's all tied together with a light but cute story about reuniting a stacking doll family.  The whole affair is pretty short (maybe 3-4 hours straight through, doubled for total completion), but feels substantial and completely sufficient for its premise.

Stacking won't blow anyone away, but is distinct and very well-crafted.  For the few hours it lasts, Stacking's game world is just fun to play around in.
