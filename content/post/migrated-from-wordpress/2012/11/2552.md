The final mission ends somewhat abruptly (as in, the ending event seems slightly unfinished), but don't take this DLC campaign's brevity as a sign of laziness -- there are a <i>ton</i> of side-missions in here that I've yet to scratch the surface of.  This being yet another way that Captain Scarlett is really more of the same <game:Borderlands 2> experience, and that definitely isn't a bad thing at all.
