Until I get a big enough group together to take advantage of Nintendo Land's multiplayer offerings, it's sort of a non-entity to me.  I was told that Metroid Blast was the most game-like of its minigames, so I tried that first, but it really didn't impress me at all.  That said, I feel like maybe the multiplayer mode - controlling bounty hunters directly rather than flying a wacky ship around using the GamePad - might be a better sell.

And why does this minigame collection need a minutes-long intro tutorial?  (It really doesn't.)
