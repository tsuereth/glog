What the hell is this <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/29800/">simple-looking</a> amateur game?  Is it a Quake mod?  Is it a lo-fi, <game:Crackdown>-meets-<game:Zone of the Enders>, hidden masterpiece?  Is it a misplaced tech demo?  Well, maybe the last one.

Look, guy who made Caster, this is an impressive solo dev project -- but that's it.  Low production value is one thing, but there's absolutely nothing of interest here.  Upgrading your physical abilities to become overpowered is pointless, when there's no compelling content to overpower.  Caster's blandness extends beyond its world, enemies, and art.  It's just a whole pile of bland.  Even calling it a pile seems like an overstatement.

Asking people to pay for this ... <i>engine proof</i> is dishonest and shameful.  Unless this is a <game:Minecraft>-type deal where the whole game will be pieced together over the next few years, but, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/?feed=steam_updates&appids=29800">no that doesn't look like it</a>.

<b>Better than</b>: actually, it might be better than <game:Jumper: Griffin's Story>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Moonbase Alpha>  
<b>Really, the screenshots should make these deficiencies obvious</b>: that'll teach me to listen to random internet commenters.
