Given a pleasant-looking aesthetic and, uh, controllable dragons, this was a painless purchase from the Steam holiday sale.  And I was impressed by the game's mechanics, which are solid and fun to boot -- progress feels swift and meaningful, and there's never a shortage of tasks to attend to on the map.  I'd definitely encourage you to try the tutorials in the free demo.

But what holds this back, for me, is that there's <b>no campaign</b>.  None whatsoever.

The gameplay is fun enough, but without an overarching goal to taunt me along, I have a very limited interest in this.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Anomaly: Warzone Earth>, in terms of mechanics and features  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Anomaly: Warzone Earth>, in terms of longevity (since, you know, no campaign)  
<b>Seriously guys</b>: I will buy a sequel/DLC pack if it includes a campaign!
