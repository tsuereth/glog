I'd always intended to come back to this game by myself, to collect bonus medals and unlock new stuff.  But the not-so-silver lining of New SMB Wii is that, although it's constructed on the same foundation that's historically made Mario a single-player joyride - complete with warp shortcuts and a special world - its levels are simply too loose and spread-out to enjoy solo.  Without other players getting in your way, it's actually a pretty light experience.

So, yeah, lost interest.  May we meet again in another game, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL9z4eIarC8">World 9</a>.
