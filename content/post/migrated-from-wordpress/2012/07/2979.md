What caught me off-guard about Half-Minute Hero was just how <i>repetitive</i> it became.  Sure, there are some side-quests and branching paths, but the game plays out identically in any case -- following NPC instructions, grinding enough to buy items and level up, then going to the boss fight.  Really the only mechanic of substance is managing the 30 second time limit and purchasing time resets, which can be fairly frustrating since there's such a small margin for error.

It isn't necessarily bad, but definitely seems more suited for bite-sized play sessions, rather than sitting down and spending real time with.  Which makes the [original (PSP) iteration](game:Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax) sound more sensible, but I have to wonder, where is the iOS/Android version?  Or even a web/Facebook version?  This game architecture seems perfect for on-the-go play, a few minutes at a time.
