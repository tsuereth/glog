Of <i>course</i> I wanted to play Ico, especially after being mostly-impressed by <game:Shadow of the Colossus>.  But my game disc wouldn't work in my PS2 (which I later found out was because the PS2 CD reader is a real piece of shit), and my experience trying to emulate the game was pretty uneven, so I basically gave up.  Fast forward to present day, and the PS3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ico_%26_Shadow_of_the_Colossus_Collection">HD remake</a> has given me another chance!  So I let my buddy take a stab at it first, since he hasn't played Ico yet either, and ... now I'm pretty lukewarm on it.

To be frank, Ico's basic dungeon-roaming and puzzle-solving gameplay has become rote and routine, today.  Which would be fine, if not for its unique and/or antiquated annoyances of escorting the dumbass Yorda around (yeah yeah, I know it's the whole point, but that doesn't make it any less irritating) and poorly-placed checkpoints that end up forcing a lot of depressing repetition.

I'm sure this would have been great, ten years ago, or even five years ago; but today, this just doesn't meet my expectations, and I don't think I have the patience for it anymore.  Sorry, Ueda-san.
