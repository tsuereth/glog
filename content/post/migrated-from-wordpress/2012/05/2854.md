I stand by my assertion that <game:Torchlight> is basically pointless, with more polish but less function than its [Blizzard forebear](game:Diablo II).  And that's why I had always figured, if Torchlight II wasn't going to come out before <game:Diablo III>, it would be pointless as well.  But now that I've been somewhat underwhelmed by Blizzard's follow-up, I've become genuinely interested in Torchlight II.

Actually, when I saw that a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/200710/">four-pack</a> of Torchlight II is the same price as <i>one</i> copy of Diablo III, I went ahead and pre-ordered it.

Obviously I'm interested in the offline and LAN play, if for no other reason than to not feel tethered to Battle.net.  I did verify that TL2 has <a href="http://torchlight.wikia.com/wiki/Multiplayer_features#Loot">unique drops for each player</a>, easily the most important mechanical innovation from Diablo III.  And while I don't know if I should expect creative and original content, I know that it can't possibly be <i>less</i> original than D3.

Anyway, at these prices, the discussion is moot -- whenever Torchlight II ends up coming out, we'll find out how good it really is.
