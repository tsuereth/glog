I was <b>immensely</b> disappointed when I found out that {{% game "Batman: Arkham City" %}}Arkham City{{% /game %}}'s DLC packs for Nightwing and Robin didn't contain any story content, but were really just challenge maps with new characters.  But I'm relatively sure that this one is going to actually extend the campaign, in which case, <i>of course I'll buy it</i>.
