Yeah, it's pretty fun!  A few quick hits:

<ul>
<li>I am a ninja.  With a sword.</li>
<li>I have a disposable shotgun -- instead of reloading, I throw it away, and it <i>explodes</i>.</li>
<li>The game's antagonist, Handsome Jack, has been talking to me about his solid diamond horse, who he named Butt Stallion.</li>
</ul>

Yup.
