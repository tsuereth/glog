Initial media for Remember Me had me pretty nonplussed (and in at least one case, distinctly <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/06/try-to-ignore-the-dialogue-in-this-exciting-remember-me-clip/">anti-plussed</a>).  But <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/21/remember-me-and-your-own-custom-combos/">this look</a> at the combat system is actually pretty impressive -- not only in its heavy customization, but in how that customization allows you to manage things like ability cooldowns and health regen <i>through beating dudes up</i>.  I'll be keeping my eyes open for this one.
