Wrapping up <game:Sleeping Dogs> left me wanting more open-world mayhem (I even tried <game:Just Cause 2> again, before becoming frustrated for all the same reasons as before), and damned if The Saboteur isn't still fun.  The game just plays beautifully, and Sean Devlin's suite of abilities holds up quite well, even three years later.

But, there is the ever-present threat of bugs in the PC version -- I've done pretty well so far, but there is apparently a <a href="http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/4593240.page">nasty issue with the in-game map</a> when using a resolution above 720p.  Which is a shame, because the game actually looks quite beautiful at 1080p.  I might just keep my resolution and try to avoid the map screen.
