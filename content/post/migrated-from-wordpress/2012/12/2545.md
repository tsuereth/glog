Pretentious, shallow, absolutely unsubstantial garbage.  The metaphor-story is underdeveloped and underwhelming.  The world design is unremarkable, a handful of tepidly interesting landmarks scattered around an otherwise bland landscape.  (The narrative is the same way -- barely intriguing when it's happening, but largely vacant.)  And interactivity is completely absent: walk along a path.

A waste of money at $2.50, and a waste of time at under an hour.  There is nothing of value here.
