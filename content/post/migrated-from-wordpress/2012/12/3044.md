On the heels of an initial shot at <game:Snapshot> - expect glogging on this game later - I became anxious to discover more about the studio behind it, Retro Affect (or in this case, just designer Kyle Pulver).  Depict1 may not last very long, but it's a clever and engaging jaunt, not to mention an audiovisual treat.  It's one of those rare games that ties its core conceit into not only the narrative, but the gameplay itself.
