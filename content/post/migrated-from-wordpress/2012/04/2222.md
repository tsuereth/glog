<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/04/20/diablo-iii-roars-into-an-open-beta-weekend/">Open beta</a>!  Yeahhhh!

I'd long ago come to accept that I would buy, and play the hell out of, Diablo III regardless of what crazy mechanical or business concerns Activision-Blizzard threw at me.  Fortunately, having now actually played it, I'm really pleased with what I'll be inevitably wasting my weekends on.

Not unlike {{% game "StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty" %}}StarCraft II{{% /game %}}, Diablo III impressively channels its predecessor - rolling through Tristram's ruins, taking apart zombies and picking up loot, the legacy of hack-and-slashing immediately rushing back - while updating and enhancing the experience for modern sensibilities.  No, it isn't brand new, and yes, there is a slight sense of (for lack of a better term) "streamlining" in the UI's familiarity with {{% game "World of Warcraft" %}}World of Warcraft{{% /game %}}.  But at its core, this is a game about exploring a map, destroying enemies, and tricking out your paper-doll with magic equipment, all in the name of tracking down evil demon lords.

It's good to be back.
