Toki Tori 2+ isn't <i>just</i> a fun puzzle-adventure, it also has a bunch of content-enhancing collectibles and achievements, that encourage even more exploration of its mystical, magical game world.

Yeah, I consulted some video and text guides to collect the final wings and stuff.  So what?  Still fun.

<i>Progress: Got all the collectible things.</i>
