Sudoku, [Picross](game:Picross DS), Boggle.  Those seem like the most direct ingredients of Lexica, where the crossword-like (but hint-less) playing field must be filled with pre-supplied letters to form words.  It's a clever idea, but it isn't really maintaining my interest.

My problem with Lexica is that it doesn't have much lexicographic direction (like crossword hints), nor does it have logically-complete constraints (like Picross); just the meticulous examination of available letters.  Ultimately the game plays more like a syllabic Sudoku than anything else, trying to complete short words or word fragments based on vowel and consonant combinations.  This seems like it would work better with pen and paper - taking notes on combinatorial options - but regardless of that, it's pretty tedious.

And even the largest game board is only six by six letters, which keeps it <i>feasible</i>, but means that the potential payoff for completing a word stays pretty low.  At least <game:Picross 3D> had some low-detail animated imagery for solved puzzles.  Lexica has all the production value of an in-flight magazine.

It's a cool concept, and I enjoyed doing a few puzzles, but I can't imagine sticking around for all <b>288</b> of them.
