<b>Of <i>course</i></b> I will buy, play, and almost certainly enjoy this <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/08/29/saints-row-5-2015/">Satan-hunting, armchair-gunning</a> power-trip.  But I still can't help but be disappointed in Volition's continuing lack of creativity with the setting.  Steelport was a milquetoast city [to begin with](game:Saints Row: The Third), and [re-treading it](game:Saints Row IV) was only fun because I could fly around like a superhero.  Given that Gat Out of Hell's world seems to bear so much architectural resemblance to SR4's simulated Steelport <i>again</i> ... I really, really hope that something bigger is in the works for Saints Row Cinco.
