From the moment <a href="http://tombraider.tumblr.com/post/94529480860/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-update">the "exclusivity" announcement</a> was made, it was obvious (if not direct) that Rise of the Tomb Raider would be coming to other platforms after the holiday.  And from the way that Microsoft, Square Enix, and Crystal Dynamics refused to explicitly state this, it became clear that the deal has a gag order on it.  Silly, and disappointing, but at least <i>comprehensible</i>.

And now the story is taking a turn into the <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-13-microsoft-confirms-rise-of-the-tomb-raider-xbox-exclusivity-deal-has-a-duration">hilariously stupid</a>, with phrases like "My job is not to talk about games I don't own," and "I can talk about the deal I have" (then proceeding to not talk about that deal).  I mean, wow.  Yesterday it would have been impossible to believe that this announcement could be made any more awkward.  But here we are.

I was looking forward to playing this game on a tricked-out PC, and I still am.  All this "exclusivity" means for me is that when I get the game, it'll probably be a few months later, and either a few dollars less, or bundled with some post-launch DLC.  At this point, the story <i>of</i> the story is infinitely more interesting than the story itself.
