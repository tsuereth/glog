I remember, back during its Japanese debut - wow, in <i>2012</i> - that Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright didn't go over so well.  I saw some blurbs about it failing to live up to the legacies of both {{% game "Professor Layton and the Curious Village" %}}Layton{{% /game %}} (whatever) and {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney" %}}Wright{{% /game %}} (well, shit) -- pretty much as expected.

Fast forward to this week, with the game's North American release somehow imminent, and the game is <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/professor-layton-vs-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney">rolling in positive reviews</a>.  This number of "greens" is nothing to sneeze at.  Not that, necessarily, I had been planning to sneeze at it.  But this reception has affected my curiosity about the game, sneezing or otherwise.
