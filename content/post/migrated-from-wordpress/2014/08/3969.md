The <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/285500/">Steam promotional content</a> had me optimistically expecting Hard Truck: Apocalypse to be some kind of middle ground between <i>Mad Max</i> and <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla>, driving around a nuked-up open world with way too many machine guns.  And, well, that's sort of accurate -- but what most strongly characterized my time in Hard Truck: Apocalypse was the <i>lack</i> of things to do.  Driving across mostly-empty expanses of barren world.  Holding down a trigger to burn down an incompetent enemy, who barely fights back or poses any risk.  Clicking through conversations where most of the dialog choices only had <b>one option</b>.  And it's not like there's an epic story to suffer through this tedium for.  What is the point?

It hardly matters that the production values are so poor, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnx_U7aR_MY">baffling voice acting</a> that sounds like it went through a few rounds of Google Translate.  The gameplay itself just isn't interesting.
