As funny as Microsoft's non-comments on {{% game "Rise of the Tomb Raider" %}}Rise of the Tomb Raider{{% /game %}} have been, I think this one really takes the Gamescom cake.  Although I must give credit to Yoshida-san for admitting - re: the game being "totally re-engineered" - that if and when The Last Guardian is seen again, it may not bear <i>any</i> resemblance to the teaser from <b>2009</b>.
