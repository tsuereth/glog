<game:Mark of the Ninja> was one of my favorites.  And in the sense that it preserves the genius gameplay formula and design talent of the core game, the Special Edition's bonus level is a fun little diversion.  But as a value proposition, the Special Edition DLC is a hard sell.

The new mission is good, but not the best, and it's the <i>only</i> new one.  The other additional content, items and a costume, aren't meaningful at all when weighed against what's already in the game.  And the developer commentary, while cool, is no better - actually, less informative - than what you could get by reading a <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a> article or any given post-mortem.

There's a fun hour or two of bonus-level in here, but otherwise the Special Edition DLC is utterly lacking in substance.
