Previous information about Shadow of Mordor (open world, Ranger, unrelated to the Fellowship) didn't really register for me.  But this <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_mordor/b/playstation4/archive/2014/01/23/new-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-footage-shows-off-wraith-abilities.aspx">new trailer</a> has my interest piqued.  Sure, between the climbing, stealth, takedowns, and counters, this tends to look like a Tolkienized Assassin's Creed, but hey -- that sounds pretty awesome to me.  The "wraith powers" thing sounds pretty awesome too, but narratively weird.  I'm definitely curious about that.

What has me a little concerned, though, is the buildup around the "nemesis" system of unique enemies who remember previous encounters.  Frankly, I expect this to be more <game:Mass Effect> than true open-endedness, e.g. there are a few variables that can change based on random chance or player decisions.  So ... we'll see how that plays out, I guess.
