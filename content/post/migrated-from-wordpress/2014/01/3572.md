Unsatisfied with <game:Saints Row IV>'s flirtations with breaking the fourth wall, Enter the Dominatrix builds a <i>fifth</i> wall - that of an in-game video documentary, regarding the game itself - and throws a bunch of bondage fetishists at it.  This being Saints Row, of course, the story only becomes more ridiculous from here.

And the story, as an encore for Volition's incredible performance in the main game, is hilarious and brilliant in its own way.  Unfortunately, there isn't <i>enough</i> of it -- even for this extremely brief, approximately hour-long DLC episode.  The missions that sit between Dominatrix's expository cutscenes are slow and sparse, and don't introduce any new (or even new-ish) gameplay.

It's hard to hate Saints Row, and, to be fair, this DLC's ending really knocks it out of the park.  But aside from about 15 or 20 minutes of good writing, there just isn't anything of value here.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Red Faction: Armageddon - Path to War>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space>  
<b>Poor</b>: Donnie.
