Every time some new promotional news comes out for Thief, I keep waffling on my opinion of it.  This <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/games/thief/b/xboxone/archive/2014/02/14/garret-robs-the-jewelry-store-in-17-minutes-of-gameplay.aspx">17 minutes of gameplay footage</a>, which seems to thoroughly illustrate the moment-to-moment experience of playing the game, ... is no different.

On the one hand, the meticulous, even tedious stealth exploration and collection shown here strongly resembles the way I tended to play <game:Dishonored>, and [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim), and <game:BioShock>.  Although it looks dull as dirt, I can see myself becoming really engrossed in sneaking around and pilfering the hell out of everyone's vaults and bedrooms.

On the other hand, is that really all that's going on here?  Dishonored, Skyrim, and BioShock all had a number of <i>other</i> major gameplay components going on, too, all of them much more bombastic and thrilling than gradually relieving a mansion of its valuables.  What else does Thief have?  I really don't know, but if you can go 17 minutes without seeing any of it, I'm not sure what significance it could have.

So: inconclusive, still.  At least there isn't much longer to wait for real reviews, which will hopefully enlighten me on what else Thief brings to the table.
