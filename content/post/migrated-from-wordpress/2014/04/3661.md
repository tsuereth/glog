Beyond the historic relevance of the original id Software productions, I have never held any significant interest in a Wolfenstein game.  (The closest I've come was playing a demo of the [2009 iteration](game:Wolfenstein), which seemed a little silly and a little bombastic but not really enough of either.)  So it's with some surprise that I find myself genuinely intrigued by what I'm seeing and hearing about Wolfenstein: The New Order.

What I'm seeing and hearing, specifically, is that the game is <i>focusing</i> on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/04/preview-confronting-nazi-horror-in-wolfenstein-the-new-order/">a compelling campaign mode</a>; that it isn't wasting design or development effort on yet another multiplayer mode; and that it is <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/04/08/wolfenstein-the-new-oder-new-gameplay-video-released/">pretty damned stylish</a>, even compared to games that <i>don't</i> include experimental Nazi superweapons.

Not that I'm ready to put down pre-order money on this thing just yet, but I never expected to have this level of interest in Wolfenstein before.
