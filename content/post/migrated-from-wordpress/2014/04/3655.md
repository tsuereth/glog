Like all good franchises, Civilization has finally (well, [again](game:Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri)) realized that [space](game:Super Mario Galaxy 2) is [awesome](game:Saints Row IV).  The announcement buzz around <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/04/12/sid-meiers-civilization-beyond-earth-announced-as-spiritual-successor-to-alpha-centuari/">Beyond Earth</a> makes it clear that, while it won't necessarily change the basic gameplay mechanics of [Civilization V](game:Sid Meier's Civilization V), it will introduce some <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/04/12/civilization-beyond-earth-interview-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-factions-aliens-technology-and-more/">very interesting wrinkles</a> regarding AI interaction and game goals.

For me, the best parts of Civ 5 were the most sci-fi parts -- stealth bombers, nuclear subs, death robots, and of course launching into space.  Pretty much everything about Beyond Earth sounds like the best part to me.
