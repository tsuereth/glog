I am really, really, really pleased that Ubisoft is taking this <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to character morality in Watch Dogs.  I'm pretty sick of games telling me when I'm being "good" or "evil," and giving me "good guy" or "bad guy" rewards as a result.  It's refreshing to hear a developer acknowledge that choices are most meaningful when you let the player build <i>their own</i> meaning out of them.
