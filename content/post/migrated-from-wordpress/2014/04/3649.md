Like, I think, most Ace Attorney aficionados, I am deeply concerned about Capcom's announcement of <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/04/25/the-great-ace-attorney-will-kick-off-a-new-series/">The Great Ace Attorney</a>.  Not because I dislike the prospective setting (which is full of new and interesting opportunities), or the presumed connections to franchise lore (which tantalizes the mind re: the previous games' Fey family) -- but because, due to it being <i>thoroughly</i> Japanese, there's a near-zero chance of Capcom taking this installment outside Japan.

For now, I'm holding out hope that Capcom USA will show some interest, maybe try a fan-petition campaign or something.  But realistically I think this is just as likely to come to America as <game:Kabu Trader Shun> is, anymore.
