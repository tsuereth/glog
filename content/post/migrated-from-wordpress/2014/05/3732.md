I got about an hour and a half into Watch Dogs before passing out last night -- I had a hard time articulating my thoughts, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_A6Z3gkXlk">this hype-to-reality comparison video</a> demonstrates the most immediate issues very well.  Pretty much everything from the 2012 demo that looked "next-gen" - the nuanced lighting, the wind physics, the density of civilians and vehicles, the <i>overall</i> level of visual spit-shine - is absent from the released product.  I'm not by any means going to claim that the game looks bad, but it looks <i>usual</i>, in the same league as (or lower than) other AAA games that have come out over the past few years; not head-and-shoulders above them, as teased.

Of course, yeah, they are just graphics.  I am just getting into the real gameplay and the narrative, which are thus far disorienting and intriguing, respectively.  Watch Dogs seems to suffer from the <game:Saints Row> (as in Saints Row 1) dilemma of having so much to do, that the map and HUD are too tightly packed to see a clear path through.  It's not the worst problem to have, to be sure, but it only further distracts me from the game world's <i>ambience</i>, reinforcing the message that -- yeah, this sure is a video game.
