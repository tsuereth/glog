I was <i>not</i> a fan of {{% game "Bastion" %}}Bastion{{% /game %}}.  To me it was a classic case of overbearing style and underdeveloped substance.  Given the tremendous amount of <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/16/transistor-launch-trailer-released/">visual polish</a> being applied to Transistor, I had no expectation for it to be any different.

But with the game's release now imminent, Supergiant is starting to actually <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/13/transistor-supergiant-interview-ps4-pc/">talk about what it is</a> -- and some bits are catching my attention.  Being hunted by "The Process."  Ability names ending with a "()" symbolic flourish.  And the game world is called Cloudbank, which leads me to believe that the setting isn't just inspired by TRON, but actually goes beyond it, into the modern-day interconnected network landscape.

Of course it could all be for naught.  Maybe I'm reading too much into this stuff.  Or maybe the computing metaphor will end up completely missing the mark (as certainly seems possible, given it mashes together "transistor" and high-level programming paradigms).  But I'm paying a hell of a lot more attention to it now than I was.
