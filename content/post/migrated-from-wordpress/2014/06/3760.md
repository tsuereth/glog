Not quite a year ago, I was <i>all about</i> Mercenary Kings.  Simple but enjoyable running-and-gunning was the glue holding together a compelling game of weapon and equipment upgrades.  And it still is!  The full version of the game adds more missions, which include more enemy types, which drop more raw materials, which can be used to craft more upgrades.  Things that make the early access version's arsenal look tame in comparison.

But the thrill of it, the <i>moment</i>, as it is, has gone.  Now I'm struggling to keep up with the missions' difficulty level, and having forgotten almost everything about my equipment, there is an added challenge in just trying to remember what plugs into what.  It feels like I've already wrung out all the enjoyment that I can ... even though I don't fully believe this is true.  And as a result I just can't get into it in the way that I had last year.

I'm sure I'll come back to this again, but for now I'm content with the mercenary-ing I've already done.

<i>Progress: Finished one of the full-version missions.</i>
