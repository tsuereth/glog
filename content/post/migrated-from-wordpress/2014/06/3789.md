LYNE is a fairly straightforward puzzle game - you, uh, draw lines - but for me the biggest puzzle is why I should care.  It's one of <i>those</i> puzzle games that, while relatively well-designed, is neither "tight" enough (meaning that each puzzle has a strict, informed solution) nor exciting enough (it's all very placid and relaxed) to really hold up against other puzzlers.  Early puzzles are staggeringly simple, and at a certain point they just become <b>fiddly</b>; while the game does a good job of introducing elements gradually, it doesn't do well at all at helping you learn nuanced solving techniques.

Maybe I'm being too hard on it, because LYNE's puzzle style is just hard for me to see in my head, as I've done in other puzzle games.  Maybe it's just me.  But, LYNE isn't really providing me with any incentive to stay interested.
