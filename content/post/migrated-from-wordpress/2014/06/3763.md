For my part, I didn't notice a <i>dramatic</i> improvement in visual fidelity or performance; but the visible results, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhvdFKQk9CA">interweb's consensus</a>, are undeniable: Watch Dogs on PC actually <i>shipped</i> with its early-tease graphical capabilities, requiring only a <a href="http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=390114">humble patch</a> to enable them.  (This makes the 14 GB digital download quite a bit easier to believe.)

As for why these effects ended up disabled, there are a number of fan theories, all boiling down to standard managerial bullshit -- the performance gain over stock settings makes it pretty clear, that dialing down the visuals was a near-last-minute decision.  The sad part is that we'll never know the truth; any official response to the debacle will be from Ubisoft PR, any technical explanation will be pointlessly uninformed, and any policy explanation will be totally untrustworthy.  But there are two ancillary aspects of this fiasco that I find interesting.

The first is that it paints a sharply-contrasting portrait to Rockstar, and <game:Grand Theft Auto IV>'s PC version: although this, too, was much maligned in its day for poor performance, it scales to <i>today's</i> hardware fantastically well.  Hell, it generally looks better than Watch Dogs on the same rig, despite being more than five years its senior.  Of course, there's still time for Watch Dogs to have this level of quality officially patched in... but given Ubisoft's track record of anemic post-release support, this doesn't seem realistic.

The second is that, even with blindingly great graphics, Watch Dogs is still <i>generally</i> incomplete and hobbled.  The driving still stinks.  The side-missions are still dull.  The emergent sandbox gameplay still isn't enticing.  The soundtrack is still ... baffling.

Ubisoft's ability to continually disappoint me is equally as undeniable as their ability to frequently rope me in with [tightly-crafted](game:Assassin's Creed III) [campaign gameplay](game:Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag) (well, [mostly](game:Far Cry 3)).  This shit-storm is really just the latest proof that, when it comes to Ubisoft games, expectations need to be tempered.
