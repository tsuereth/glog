"Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube" - or simply <i>Qbeh</i> as a less-insane person might call it - is not quite what it at first appears to be.  It certainly has all the apparent trappings of a first-person room-puzzler in the vein of <game:Portal>/[2](game:Portal 2), <game:Antichamber>, <game:Q.U.B.E.>, et al.  But inbetween the puzzle portions of Qbeh lies an environmentally-driven, highly-aesthetic experience, not unlike <game:Kairo>.  There's a complete lack of narrative backdrop; only a wide open cube-world to look out at.  Significant swaths of each level have no mechanical relevance at all; just grand vistas and fascinating architecture.  The water and lighting effects on display here are surprisingly high-quality, for how humble a production it is overall.

And, well, it's a good thing that Qbeh looks as gorgeous as it does.  At least so far, there isn't much else going for it -- the puzzles are pretty reliant on semi-awkward platforming, and the basic puzzle mechanic of the first few levels (placing and removing blocks) becomes repetitive in short order.  There are barely even any <i>hints</i> of new mechanics, so far.  Here's hoping they start to show up soon.
