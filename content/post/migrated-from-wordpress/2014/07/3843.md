I can't be certain if the developers of Puzzle Bots <i>intended</i> for it to be a slow, dull, schlocky {{% game "Ben There, Dan That!" %}}homage{{% /game %}} to point-and-click adventure games from 20 years ago; or if they legitimately found a {{% game "Time Gentlemen, Please!" %}}time machine{{% /game %}}, and recovered this game from Lucasarts circa 1990.  But deliberate or otherwise, its primitive mechanics and flat narrative make it hard to maintain any amount of interest in.

<i>Progress: Made it to the kitchen.</i>
