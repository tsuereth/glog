Granted, I played it out of its release-date sequence -- but New Super Mario Bros. 2 just feels indefensibly <i>not-new</i>.  The "New" SMB formula has [run](game:New Super Mario Bros.) [its](game:New Super Mario Bros. Wii) [course](game:New Super Mario Bros. U).  And this installment's unique feature - excessive coin-collecting - just isn't that interesting.  The moment-to-moment gameplay feels stale and sterile.

Also, I don't seem to be able to tolerate the 3DS's physical buttons as much as I used to.  At least not in a realtime platforming context.  Not sure why it's different now, but, holding 'Y' and pressing 'B' intermittently feels strangely uncomfortable.
