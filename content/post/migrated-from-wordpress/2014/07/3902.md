It took well over an hour of gameplay for me to get to what, I felt, <i>should</i> be the game's second level -- based on the complexity of its platform and puzzle design.  This was actually the <i>tenth</i> level.  Or maybe the eleventh.  It's hard to remember, because they all blur together; as beautiful as QBEH can look, its environments quickly become repetitive and dull.

With the game's lack of mechanics and glacial pacing - oh yeah, the second type of puzzle cube is ... barely different from the first - the burden of motivating the player falls upon the world design.  And the world doesn't have enough features or variety to be compelling, either.

QBEH isn't a bad game, but perhaps overestimates its ability to entice and excite, and feels overextended as a result.  I think it would have worked much better if there were just less, faster-paced levels.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Kairo" %}}Kairo{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Q.U.B.E." %}}Q.U.B.E.{{% /game %}}  
<b>Also</b>: the name, I mean, really?  I guess it's a prequel to a game called <a href="http://www.desura.com/games/qbeh">just Qbeh</a>.  Why is this installment numbered '1' and with a subtitle?  It just sounds ridiculous.
