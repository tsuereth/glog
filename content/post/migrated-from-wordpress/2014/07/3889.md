Greed Corp's deceptively simple mechanics are implemented <i>really</i> well -- the ways in which they balance and counteract each other can turn the tide of a match in an instant.  Consequently, skillful play involves a chess-like ability to think many moves ahead, predicting wildly disparate branches of possibility.

Unfortunately, I don't have this skill.  And the game's campaign requires it pretty quickly: before the end of its first-of-four series of faction-specific missions.

I know when I'm beat.  And I'm comfortable admitting that this (again, well-made) game has simply gotten the better of me.

<i>Progress: Finished uh... four campaign levels.</i>
