Papers, Please isn't fun.  I know that's the point.  But that doesn't <i>make</i> it fun.  It's a slow, gruelling, depressing, irritatingly inconvenient exercise in simulated bureaucracy.  Each progressive day at the border checkpoint adds more paperwork bullshit to deal with -- reading data, verifying it against the rulebook, clicking this, dragging that, clicking another thing... ugh.  I don't want to do <i>any</i> of these things.

Wait, what?  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/papers-please">People actually like this?</a>

I just don't understand the appeal, at all.
