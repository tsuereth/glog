Element4l is a dumb game with a dumb name.  The controls are fidgety, the graphics are obnoxious (glowing objects obscure vital on-screen elements!), the environments are dull, and when you get right down to it, the gameplay formula - using a small number of elemental abilities to avoid obstacles and traverse levels - isn't fun.  Element4l completely failed to grab my attention in its opening levels, and the videos I've seen of later levels don't really look any different.

<i>Progress: not much.</i>
