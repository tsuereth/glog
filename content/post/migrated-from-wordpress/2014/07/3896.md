I wasn't super-into {{% game "Shank" %}}Shank{{% /game %}}, as I recall -- its button-mashy combat formula was okay, but, not really my thing.  Where {{% game "Mark of the Ninja" %}}Mark of the Ninja{{% /game %}} really impressed me with its mechanical polish and sophisticated objectives, Shank felt more lke a loosely-defined muder-and-mayhem sandbox (murderbox?).  Shank 2, somehow, manages to feel even <i>less</i> well-defined than its predecessor: there are variable loadouts, such that even the most basic assumption of what weapons to use, no longer held up; and as soon as the first level, a significant number of varied enemy types tackled me at once, demanding mastery over the controls that the tutorial really hadn't prepared me for.

I lamented of the original Shank that it lacked in pretty much everything, except hit-or-miss ultra-hectic action.  Shank 2 seems to be made for the player who wanted more of exactly that, at the expense of everything else.
