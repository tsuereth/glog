<a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/13/tales-from-the-borderlands-video-and-pricing-released/">Humor</a>.  That's ... pretty much how adventure games are "supposed" to work, for me.  (Chalk that bias up to <game:Sam & Max Hit the Road>.)  I'm still wary of Telltale's fare, but this combination of <game:Borderlands> themes, excellent voice acting, and <b>irreverence</b> just might be enough to change my mind.  Maybe.
