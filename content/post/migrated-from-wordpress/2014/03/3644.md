With its <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/03/27/watch-dogs-video-welcomes-you-to-chicago/">newest trailer</a>, and its narrative ... <i>familiarity</i>, Ubisoft's real intent for Watch Dogs suddenly becomes obvious.  This isn't an attempt to bring Assassin's Creed into the modern day; this is an attempt to unseat Rockstar.  Their proposal is to make a modern day, activity-dense open world with constant interactivity -- by way of a pervasive in-game communication network, such that even virtually-distant things are always at the ready.  The fact that this smartphone-infested techscape mirrors real life is almost a coincidence.

Really, given the publisher's glut of open-world experience, it seems attainable.  All they have to do (and here "all" is a somewhat facetious understatement) is nail some fun driving physics, and write real, believable and entertaining characters.  Those two bits, along with a varied and engaging sandbox, are the keys to the GTA kingdom.  And Ubisoft already has that last one down.
