<game:BioShock Infinite> was already a big download at somewhere slightly south of 20 GB, but not out of the question for a blockbuster AAA game in 2013.  [Burial at Sea - Episode 1](game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1), at about 5 GB, was pretty hefty for DLC (not to mention for <i>short</i> DLC).  But this - <b>9 gigabytes</b> for the Episode 2 download - just seems unjustifiable.

Given Episode 1, I guess my offhand estimate would be a ratio of about half an hour per gigabyte.  (Which is already pretty terrible.)  Let's see what Episode 2 can actually deliver.
