Apparently, it could be made <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2">not fun</a> by introducing <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/r40ufh/castlevania--lords-of-shadow-2-review">hilariously stupid</a> stealth sequences.  I mean... really?

The lynchpin of the [original](game:Castlevania: Lords of Shadow) was its <game:God of War>-styled combat, which some people apparently loved, even though I could never get into it.  MercurySteam almost certainly would have been better-served by iterating on that, with legitimately new enemies and techniques etc., than by introducing half-baked mechanics like sneaking or [Uncharted](game:Uncharted: Drake's Fortune)-ing.  By all appearances, this sequel reeks of the same kind of harebrained scope-creep that made the middle [Assassin's](game:Assassin's Creed Brotherhood) [Creed](game:Assassin's Creed Revelations) installments so disorienting and awkward.
