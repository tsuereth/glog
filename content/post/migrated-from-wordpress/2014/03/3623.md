Apparently, it could be made <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2">not fun</a> by introducing <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/r40ufh/castlevania--lords-of-shadow-2-review">hilariously stupid</a> stealth sequences.  I mean... really?

The lynchpin of the {{% game "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow" %}}original{{% /game %}} was its {{% game "God of War" %}}God of War{{% /game %}}-styled combat, which some people apparently loved, even though I could never get into it.  MercurySteam almost certainly would have been better-served by iterating on that, with legitimately new enemies and techniques etc., than by introducing half-baked mechanics like sneaking or {{% game "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" %}}Uncharted{{% /game %}}-ing.  By all appearances, this sequel reeks of the same kind of harebrained scope-creep that made the middle {{% game "Assassin's Creed Brotherhood" %}}Assassin's{{% /game %}} {{% game "Assassin's Creed Revelations" %}}Creed{{% /game %}} installments so disorienting and awkward.
