Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is a gorgeously-rendered, finely-tuned platform game with fun mechanics and challenging designs.  But I have the same problem with it that I had with its predecessor, {{% game "Donkey Kong Country Returns" %}}Donkey Kong Country Returns{{% /game %}}.  It is too hard for me.  It wracks my brain to consider that, nearly 20 years ago, a smaller, dumber version of me had practiced and mastered the living hell out of this game's equally-intricate forebears on the Super NES.

If I were to have the same liberties today that I had back then - literally nothing to do all day except retry minecart stages over and over again - then, maybe, I could make meaningful progress in Tropical Freeze.  But I <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sweet-brown-aint-nobody-got-time-for-that">ain't got the time</a> for all that, anymore.
