Rocksteady's back at the helm, so that's definitely good.  Playable Batmobile ... could go either way.  Otherwise, there's sadly little in the <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2014/03/04/batman-arkham-knight-listed-by-uk-retailer-game/">Arkham Knight reveal</a> to go on -- other than the obvious, like that it'll be packed in with Nvidia's newest GTX line, and that there'll be retailer-specific costume packs, and that I'll pretty much buy it no matter what.

Honestly, though, I'm a little disappointed that we won't be seeing a retro-stylized <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/07/11/report-rocksteadys-next-batman-game-to-be-a-silver-age-based-p/">Silver Age</a> game from Rocksteady instead.  (Whatever happened to that?  Was that what turned into [Arkham Origins](game:Batman: Arkham Origins) after all?  Man, that would be a shame.)
