I picked this up the other week on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/6486/">super Steam sale</a>, although I haven't had many chances to play it recently.  Now that the dust around its release has settled, I've gotten over the fact that it isn't a {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}Guerrilla{{% /game %}}-style open-world -- although the story isn't very remarkable, it's solid enough, and the campaign pacing is sophisticated enough, that the moment-to-moment gameplay is actually pretty compelling.  (Being able to blow everything up helps, too.)

While Guerrilla included an extra mode for just blowing up buildings with a time limit, Armageddon has the brilliance to include a "Free Play" version of this as well: so you can pick a loadout, with infinite ammo, and just blow the hell out of bridges, cooling towers, and multistory complexes.  It's a small touch, but despite the absence of a proper open world, this Ruin Mode is a great way to jump in for a few minutes at a time and disintegrate some load-bearing walls.

So it's pretty fun so far, although it lacks the sheer intensity of a {{% game "Gears of War" %}}Gears of War{{% /game %}}, and its high-powered weapons and destructible objects don't feel like a perfect fit for the extremely linear campaign.

But the most important thing I've taken away so far is, when it isn't just farming the port out to a foreign contractor, Volition is very capable of making a good PC game.  It's stable, it runs great, and it controls great.  This is what gave me the confidence to pre-order {{% game "Saints Row: The Third" %}}Saints Row 3{{% /game %}}.
