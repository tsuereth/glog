I've been, shall we say, <i>reluctant</i> to return to Super Meat Boy for one reason, and it's a disappointing reason.  While <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/super-meat-boy">reviews</a> of SMB have emphasized that it is legitimately challenging, and that overcoming its challenges is an accomplishment unto itself, I must contend that this is not always the case -- while the majority of the game's levels are rewarding (even <i>educational</i>) in their attempts to murdelate Meat Boy, there is a non-trivial remainder of levels which are purely and simply sadistic.  For instance, the boss level that I haven't bothered to finish, because it relies on me dying a lot and memorizing which parts of the stage to avoid when the boss destroys them.

Sure, I could look it up on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/604976-super-meat-boy/faqs">l'internet</a> and simply recite the required moves, but this level is symptomatic of others in the game that, well, do that Mega Man thing -- you need to die a bunch before you can determine how <i>not</i> to die a bunch.  Super Meat Boy's die-and-retry delay isn't quite as forgiving as <game:VVVVVV>'s, and the parts of the game that aren't "stupidly" difficult, are "actually" difficult; so finally overcoming a difficult jump challenge after ten tries, only to explode spontaneously, is especially discouraging.

Super Meat Boy is pretty good, but I don't think it quite lives up to its ambitions.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Limbo>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:VVVVVV>  
<b>It's <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/">fairly cheap</a></b>: so you might as well buy it just to see how far you get.  The levels that aren't annoying are pretty goddamn fun!
