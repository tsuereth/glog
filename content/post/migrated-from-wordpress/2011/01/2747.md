The grand irony of Red Dead Redemption is that, while its Wild West is leagues less busy and populated than [Liberty City](game:Grand Theft Auto IV), it has significantly more meaningful side-missions and naturally emergent gameplay.  Personally I miss the cars and highways -- but Redemption does a good job of keeping things entertaining, aside from some menial ranch work (which I guess is John Marston's equivalent of going bowling or playing pool).  And of course, the storytelling is excellent, even if the "reforming outlaw with a grudge to settle" premise is a little familiar.
