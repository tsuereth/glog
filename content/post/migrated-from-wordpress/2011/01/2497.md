Funny story: I bought Cataclysm before it came out, so I could pre-load the game, and play it immediately.  Since then I've logged in for a sum total of, maybe four hours, tops.

My hectic work schedule certainly had something to do with it.  But even when I started to have free time again - even on lazy weekends - I wasn't really that compelled to play.  And when I did pick it up, I simply couldn't stay in it that long.

Cataclysm adds a host of new features to the World of Warcraft, and changes the existing game parameters so significantly, that it forces you to take a fresh look at WoW's core mechanics.  And maybe that's why I've become so disinterested in it.  With all its new gears and widgets, with all the layers of fresh paint, this is still World of Warcraft -- and even if it's better than ever, it's still based on a six-year-old game design.

Maybe in a few months I'll want to give it another whirl.  But until then, I've got plenty of other games to play.
