I can't hail Limbo as a work of genius.  It isn't as creative as {{% game "VVVVVV" %}}VVVVVV{{% /game %}}, or as challenging as {{% game "Super Meat Boy" %}}Super Meat Boy{{% /game %}}, or as elegant as {{% game "Braid" %}}Braid{{% /game %}}.  The cold open makes the game's few controls a little confusing to figure out, and the monochrome graphics have the {{% game "MadWorld" %}}MadWorld{{% /game %}} issue of occasionally obscuring important information.  That being said, it does very well for itself -- the environment is engrossing, the controls are solid, and the puzzles are genuinely clever.

What's most interesting about Limbo is the single-take design: setting aside its generous checkpoints, the entire game is one uninterrupted stream of level.  It's a neat concept, and the puzzle design is to be commended for keeping the mostly-constant environment from becoming tedious.
