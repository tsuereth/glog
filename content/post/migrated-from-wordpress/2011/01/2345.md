I can't hail Limbo as a work of genius.  It isn't as creative as <game:VVVVVV>, or as challenging as <game:Super Meat Boy>, or as elegant as <game:Braid>.  The cold open makes the game's few controls a little confusing to figure out, and the monochrome graphics have the <game:MadWorld> issue of occasionally obscuring important information.  That being said, it does very well for itself -- the environment is engrossing, the controls are solid, and the puzzles are genuinely clever.

What's most interesting about Limbo is the single-take design: setting aside its generous checkpoints, the entire game is one uninterrupted stream of level.  It's a neat concept, and the puzzle design is to be commended for keeping the mostly-constant environment from becoming tedious.
