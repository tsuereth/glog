Another difference between Epic Yarn and {{% game "Muramasa: The Demon Blade" %}}Muramasa{{% /game %}} is that I was able to return to Kirby after a months-long hiatus <i>without</i> reading the instruction manual.  I may have complained that Muramasa's mechanics weren't deep enough, but - as should be expected for any Kirby romp - Epic Yarn will make any other game's control scheme look like a Rube Goldberg device by comparison.

And while I would ordinarily consider this kind of mechanical shallowness to be detrimental to a game, Epic Yarn (again, like most Kirby adventures) really succeeds at making simplicity fun.  Figuring out puzzles in a few seconds; being surprised by an enemy, but immediately conquering it anyway; and just enjoying the gorgeous visual style make Epic Yarn a real treat.  Maybe it would be more accurate to say that you'll "enjoy" this game, rather than "play" it.

Even if you don't give half a shit about going for high scores and collecting Kirby furniture, which I sure didn't, I think gamers of all disciplines can get some enjoyment out of Epic Yarn's simple gameplay and charming presentation.
