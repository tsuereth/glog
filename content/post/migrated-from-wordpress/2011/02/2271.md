My opinions so far of Alpha Protocol are: 1) it's a lot like <game:Mass Effect> - almost like it was <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/22/wtf-fable-characters-in-sonic-racing-and-other-oddities-from-al/">intentional</a> - and 2) somewhat to my surprise, it's <i>not terrible</i>.

First off, let me throw in my two cents about the game's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Protocol#Reception">alleged bugginess</a> -- yeah.  It is buggy.  The enemy AI is a little baffling, <i>the mouse</i> is beyond the comprehension of most of the game's menus, and I've already had to reload a save file because I got stuck in a wall.  But you know?  I can't really say that it's worse than any Bethesda or BioWare game.  It's not an excuse for Obsidian, but I hate that <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-3">the</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mass-effect">internet</a> gives some developers a pass for these same technical shortcomings.

ANYWAY!  Clearly, Alpha Protocol isn't a great game.  Its brazen imitation of many Mass Effect elements - the hacking minigames, the dialog wheel, the character progression system, even the level design - is a bit disappointing, and the narrative, with all its player-choice twists and foibles, is interesting but comes across as incomplete.  Nevertheless, it is pretty cool how open-ended the mission structure is -- how each part of a level is open to gung-ho gunmanship, or stealth, or sabotage, or any combination thereof.

At its best, it has a cool, James Bond feel to it, although some spotty cover and a general vagueness about enemy line-of-sight can occasionally turn a stealth run into an unexpected shootout.
