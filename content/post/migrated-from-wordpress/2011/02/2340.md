While I lost interest in [A Boy and His Blob](game:A Boy and His Blob (2009)) from boredom, I've lost interest in Splosion Man due to frustration.  Splosion Man has surprised me more than once with the introduction of a new twist on its singular mechanic -- but the consistently poor checkpoint placement, occasional irritating platforms that require precision the controls have trouble affording, and blind deaths that I've mentioned already, all make it hard to stick with the game after more than a level or two.

It's a shame, because as with A Boy and His Blob, it's basically a fun game with plenty of levels to enjoy, as long as you've got the time and patience for it.
