It starts out super-easy, but the levels - or at least, the optional collectibles - quickly ramp up the challenge.  A few of the later levels in chapter 1 had me scratching my head for 10+ minutes trying to figure out a path.

There's a surprising amount of content, too, with four chapters of 12 levels each.  And, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vy9MCX7R-Hw">minigames</a>, apparently.
