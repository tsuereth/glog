I'll be formulating a much more detailed critique later.  One thing I want to be sure to emphasize is that, occasional dialog anachronisms aside, the story's reactions to choices I made in the campaign really made me question whether it was equipped to handle such significantly different paths -- or whether it was simply an elaborate ruse to let me believe that my choices had any consequence.  (<a href="http://alphaprotocol.wikia.com/wiki/Alpha_Protocol_Wiki">Further investigation</a> suggests the former.)  In either event - again, discounting some writing wrinkles - I would consider Alpha Protocol to be the first game that made me think my choices re: character relationships were <i>meaningful</i>, e.g. meaning something other than a different dialog response.
