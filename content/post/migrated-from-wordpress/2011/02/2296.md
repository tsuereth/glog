Magicka has brilliant game mechanics - with one player, or with more - and a fantastic sense of humor.  Basically, it's an amazing game.  But it's held back by some unfair balancing (fast attacks that keep you stunned, one-hit kill moves from stupid yetis) and some remaining bugginess.  I tried the Challenge mode with a buddy, and it was extremely fun, up until we kept falling through the ground.

It's a shame that Magicka isn't all that it could be, but it's still an incredible game that you really have to try.
