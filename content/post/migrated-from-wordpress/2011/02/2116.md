The presentation is pleasant, the level design is inventive, the puzzles are clever, the controls are passable (mostly great, but with a few blob-calling frustrations), there are generous checkpoints, dozens of levels, boss fights, hidden collectibles, a hug button -- A Boy and His Blob seems like it ticks all the right boxes.  But there's something missing: tension.

Since there's no narrative at all, the game relies on its introduction of new mechanics - meaning, new blob transformations - to keep itself fresh.  But past the first few, they never really felt like they changed how I was playing the game.  And without the promise of new, exciting challenges in the next level, my only motivation to finish the current level is the sense of accomplishment, which, by the end of the first world, has already worn a little thin.

Because A Boy and His Blob is so slow-paced and relaxing (which is good in its own way; it's important that not every game is a <game:Vanquish>-style hectic actionfest), I'm simply not that motivated to see it through.  It's a good game though, brimming with content, and if you're in the mood for it, it can be plenty of fun.
