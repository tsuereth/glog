Hahahaha!

Wanted isn't all bad: the sliding-to-cover mechanic is a neat feature, as are the bullet acrobatics you can pull off, and its take on quick-time events -- the game goes into super-slow-mo, and you have to shoot down airborne bullets, plus the dudes who fired them.  Plus, the story generally moves at a fast pace, with most levels lasting only a few minutes (except the last level, which seems longer than the rest of the game put together).

But if you play the free demo, you'll see all of these mechanics at their best, which is still not that great.  In execution, all of Wanted's cool tricks rely on good level design and event scripting, which the game has almost none of.  There are a few sequences where you have to slide from cover to cover around a room, taking out flunkies and ultimately reaching the boss, but that's about as sophisticated as it ever gets.

Take all that, and throw in some dubious graphics - the characters' running animations are surprisingly awkward, and cutscenes are artifacted like a low-quality Youtube video - a story that's as stupid as it is terrible, and aiming sensitivity that never seems quite good enough.  Wanted has some cool ideas, but is nevertheless a great bad game, right up there with {{% game "Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard" %}}Eat Lead{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Jurassic: The Hunted" %}}Jurassic: The Hunted{{% /game %}}.
