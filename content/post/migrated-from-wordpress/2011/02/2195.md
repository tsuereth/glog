The story is unspeakably slow, the combat ranges from tedious to frustrating - fighting with a limited moveset and no backup simply isn't fun - and the out-of-combat gameplay (character building, item management, etc.) is just poorly conceived.

In so many words, it's no good.  If you're a Kingdom Hearts nut, and can put up with the grind, there's almost certainly some lore in here for you -- for me, there's nothing.
