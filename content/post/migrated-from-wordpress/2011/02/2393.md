In its second iteration, the Penny Arcade Adventures formula still feels fresh and inviting.  The writing and pacing seem more polished, as does the technological package in general, although there are still some mechanical eccentricities -- like the insufficient item system, and some enemy attacks, especially bosses, which inadequately telegraph their block timing.  At its core though, the game hasn't changed much, and its amusing world is still a delight.

That's why I'll continue to hold out hope for Episode 3, though it may be <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/tag/Penny-Arcade-Adventures-Episode-3/">utterly futile</a>.
