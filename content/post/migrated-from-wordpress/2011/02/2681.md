Monkey Island 2 SE looks and sounds great, and fixes almost all of the mechanical problems I took issue with from the first Monkey Island SE.  But I couldn't help but come away from it unsatisfied -- not just because of the weird, nonsensical ending, but because of its overabundance of Adventure Game Annoyances.  There are way too many inventory items; too many environmental objects with completely unintuitive uses; too many puzzles that use cartoon logic (a monkey wrench? really?); and in general, too much of the game seems to assume that you'll keep clicking on things until it works.  Even with the item-highlight feature and the in-game hints, I still had to consult the <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/991336-monkey-island-2-special-edition-lechucks-revenge/faqs">interweb</a> quite a few times.

So just as with the more modern examples of <game:Ben There, Dan That!> and <game:Time Gentlemen, Please!>, I can't help but feel that the simple joys of the initial game have been diluted by arbitrary and tiresome overcomplication.  If this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island_2#Reception">"one of the greatest"</a> classic adventure games, then I think I can consider myself done with the genre.

<b>Better than</b>: technologically, <game:The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <i>fun</i>-ologically, <game:The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition>  
<b>I think point-and-click adventures were more tolerable</b>: when there weren't so many other, more exciting games to play instead
