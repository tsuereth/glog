Based on the demo, I described Bulletstorm to a co-worker as "{{% game "MadWorld" %}}MadWorld{{% /game %}} with guns."  (It doesn't hurt that their protagonists have the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089710/">same voice</a>.)  At any rate, it's hard to describe the feeling you get when you kick an enemy into the air, then shoot him in the junk, with a trajectory that finally lands him on a bed of spikes.

If there's a substantial campaign to go along with the kill-scoring system, this could be a real winner.
