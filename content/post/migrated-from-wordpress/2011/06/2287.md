<b>Rant time</b> - I was more than a little depressed at news of Magicka's new PvP patch and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/5707/">spate of DLC packs</a>.  The original game was full of directed, but chaotic gameplay, in imaginative and well-paced environments, framed by some fantastic writing.  Instead of adding more of <i>any</i> of that, or even ironing out some of the crippling bugs that remain in the game, Arrowhead/Paradox have added features I absolutely don't care about, and released extra content that does nothing for me.  I suppose it's possible that someone, somewhere, is really interested in incredibly unbalanced PvP, new arena levels, and paid costumes for their little wizards.  But it amazes me how much this is the <i>precise opposite</i> of what I want.
