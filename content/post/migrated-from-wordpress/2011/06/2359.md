What's interesting about DNF is that it <i>came out</i> -- not that it came out <i>bad</i>.  "Stupid" is the best way I can describe it.  And after 14 (!) years in development, it only makes sense that this game is the relic of a bygone era, that at its core it remains loyal to hamstrung control schemes and threadbare mechanics.

I shouldn't be disappointed or surprised; but I am, because of <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_duke_nukem/">this 2009 Wired article</a> which explained in detail the fall of 3D Realms.  The general spirit of Duke Nukem Forever's astonishingly appropriate name was, supposedly, that they became slavishly devoted to keeping the game's technology up-to-date, to refining its gameplay, and to keeping it fresh and current.  Frankly, aside from its maybe-2006?-ish graphics, none of that bears out in the game itself.

This is, for all intents and purposes, a high-resolution texture pack for a turn-of-the-millenium shooter.  And it's proof that 3D Realms really was full of shit the whole time.
