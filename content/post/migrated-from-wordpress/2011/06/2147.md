Yesterday me and some of my coworkers were browsing the indie games on Xbox Live, going through nonsensical card games and retarded twin-stick shooters, until finally arriving at this masterpiece.  TKA is mechanically simple and, admittedly, dumb -- hold a button to slowly rise, or let it go to slowly fall, while scrolling through a level and avoiding obstacles.  What makes this game brilliant is that it uses a trippy aesthetic and flashy graphics, synced with blaring house/rave music, to distract the shit out of you the whole time.  Rainbows explode in every direction, lasers wipe across the play field, the whole screen strobes, even the current and high score counters will pulse and slide around, all while you're trying to guide a cat wearing a jetpack through an obstacle course.

I didn't play much of it myself, but the demo was awesome enough that I couldn't resist buying it ($3) and watching my coworker play through, unlocking all the playable cats in each stage.

Techno Kitten Adventure is <i>so</i> stupid and over-the-goddamn-top that you can't help but love it.
