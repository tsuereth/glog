I haven't played the Saints Row games before, having been given the general impression that they were a poor man's Grand Theft Auto.  But <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/24/saints-row-the-third-dev-walkthrough-introduces-faces-to-the-pa/">this video</a>, in which - among other things - the narrator enters a sci-fi spacecraft and microwaves cars on the ground, makes me feel like <i>this</i> game might be the sequel to <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla> that I <i>really</i> wanted, instead of [Armageddon](game:Red Faction: Armageddon).  I'll be keeping an eye on it.
