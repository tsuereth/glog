My [last pre-order](game:L.A. Noire) disappointed me pretty hard.  This time, I'm hoping the <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/shadows-of-the-damned/13828">video evidence</a> is more indicative of the real game experience.  As another Goichi Suda and Shinji Mikami joint, I'm hoping for something with the bizarre entertainment and gameplay factors of <game:Killer7>, but with the sophistication of the more modern <game:No More Heroes> and <game:Vanquish>; and judging by the presence of a gun upgrade called the "<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/29/suda-and-mikami-get-silly-in-shadows-of-the-damned-dev-diary/">Big Boner</a>" I'm pretty excited.
