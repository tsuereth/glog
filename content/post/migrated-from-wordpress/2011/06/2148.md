Yeah!  It's available.  Cool.

In the same way that <game:BioShock 2> was more <game:BioShock>, Minerva's Den is more BioShock 2 -- Rapture, plasmids, Big Daddy drill, Adam collection, Little Sister defense, blah, blah, blah.  The mechanics are all here, anyway; the story is necessarily simplified, and while it is a little lacking in potency and memorable characters, I appreciate that it doesn't just try to one-up the original BioShock by making up another rival for Andrew Ryan.

It's hard to write much more about the DLC so far; the new levels look and feel a lot like your previous adventures in Rapture.  There is a laser gun weapon, but it isn't powerful enough to be really cool; there's a new black-hole plasmid, but other than as a puzzle mechanic it doesn't seem useful.  And with its lackluster story, the whole package is a bit underwhelming.  But it does still scratch that tension/exploration/forensic/scavenger itch.
