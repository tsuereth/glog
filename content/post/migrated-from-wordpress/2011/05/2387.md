Tried it again, got to the evac point, tried walling myself inbetween the rocks and a constant stream of napalm strikes but it just wasn't enough.  The final area is just too big and full of enemies for one player, which is pretty irritating since the rest of the mission up to that point (~20 minutes depending on how thorough you are with side-objectives) is absolutely doable solo, and asking your friends to shell out $5 for a single mission isn't very cool.

I digress, though.  Magicka: Vietnam is worth buying only if you feel like you owe Arrowhead and Paradox more money for Magicka.  By itself, it simply isn't worth it.

<b>Better than</b>: that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/73033/">other DLC pack</a> that just came out  
<b>Not as good as</b>: a real expansion, or real improvements to the game  
<b>But</b>: it's still Magicka, so there's that, at least
