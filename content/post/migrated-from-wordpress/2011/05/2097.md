So there's <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/05/03/no-pc-demo-for-red-faction-armageddon/">no PC demo</a>.  Doesn't build confidence in the readiness of the PC version -- whatever.  Not a huge surprise, and not my biggest worry about how [GTA on Mars](game:Red Faction: Guerrilla) is being sequelized.

Actually, the demo was somewhat reassuring about the general quality of gameplay: Armageddon controls well, has some cool weapons, neat new gimmicks (the Repair ability is far from a one-off, even within the brief demo level), and is sufficiently destructive to differentiate it from other third-person shooters.  I even climbed into a powered armor suit and punched the shit out of some alien monsters.

My big concern though, is that, given this game takes place underground, I may not be able to <b>drive through buildings</b>.  Even if Armageddon is a more finely-tuned shooter than its predecessor, ...well, <i>especially</i> if it's more finely-tuned, my favorite parts of Guerrilla - the Michael Bay levels of unbelievable chaos and destruction - simply won't be possible.  I'll wait and see how this one turns out.
