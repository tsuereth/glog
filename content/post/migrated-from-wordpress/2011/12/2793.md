I'm lukewarm on Metal Gear, and the reveal of Platinum Games being behind this is slightly intriguing, but what's really got me interested is how much <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/12/10/just-like-we-said-metal-gear-rising-revengeance-developed-by-p/">the VGA reveal trailer</a> reminds me of No More Heroes.  At least, the villain is channeling Travis Touchdown in his hardass nihilistic attitude, and the trailer is cut in the same way Goichi Suda emulates Quentin Tarantino.

If the rest of the game is like this, I might be able to put up with some overlong cutscenes of it; and hopefully, the slice-and-dice gameplay is at least as well-implemented as {{% game "Vanquish" %}}Vanquish{{% /game %}}.
