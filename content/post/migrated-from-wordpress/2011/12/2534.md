I expect that first-timers will not be as pleased with OoT 3D as those who have played it before.  As I mentioned, there were a number of instances where I got by purely because I <i>remembered</i> what I was supposed to do; Navi's advice wasn't super-helpful, and knocking around Hyrule to figure out my next step would have been more than a bit frustrating.

But if you've got fond memories of the original - or feel willing to put up with a few relics of game design from the 1990s - this is the <b>definitive</b> version.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword> (forgiving Ocarina's occasional lack of clarity)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess> (forgiving Twilight Princess's occasional long-windedness)  
<b>Now how about</b>: [Wind Waker](game:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker) 3D?  Toon-shading with depth sounds pretty awesome, right?
