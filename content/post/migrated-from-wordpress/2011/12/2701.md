When the game told me I could re-do the final mission and take the "other" choice (in an obvious binary decision) for an alternate ending, I didn't anticipate how different it would actually be.  Rather than saving my friends and going on to do a parody mission on a TV-set Mars, I snapped a gang leader's neck, and proceeded to fight back against a citywide invasion of sci-fi SWAT.  While the Mars ending was more in line with SR3's outlandish zaniness, the <i>Daedalus</i> ending is a more natural conclusion to the "story," and still manages to be awesomely over the top.  Plus, I unlocked some cool new equipment out of it (black VTOL!).

I've spent more than a few hours recently filling in the rest of my progress in Steelport -- finding hidden items, doing assassination missions, stealing wanted vehicles.  The latter still posed some challenge despite the fact that I've upgraded myself into invincibility, since I had to actually get the vehicles to buyers without them blowing up.  At this point I've done <a href="http://www.saintsrow.com/profile/tsuereth">everything</a> the game has to offer aside from some of the achievement-like "Challenges" (such as accumulated wheelie distance, or taking N hostages), and while I'm pretty satisfied with what Saints Row has given me, I thirst for more.

I really hope that this time, Volition delivers some worthwhile DLC, although based on [past](game:Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands) [experience](game:Red Faction: Armageddon - Path to War) I don't have a whole lot of confidence.
