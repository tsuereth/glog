Less content, no story (as far as I know), worse controls, lower-fidelity graphics and sound; but I'd expected this downloadable port of the original GBA [Four Swords](game:The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords) to come up short when compared to [Four Swords Adventures](game:The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures).  What I didn't expect was, in single-player mode, you can't control all four Links; you only get <b>two</b>.

What's the point?  I'm not at all interested in a Zelda <i>Two</i> Swords.  It needs more <i>swords</i>.  And if I have to meet up with other players to get them, well, no thank you.
