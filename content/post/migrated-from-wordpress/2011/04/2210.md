Despite some gorgeous portal and gel effects, the Source engine is (still) showing its age in a few particular ways, like fire and explosions.  The single-player story's pacing isn't perfect: each of the game's three acts start strong, but peter out as they proceed.  And loading screens seem unduly long and frequent.  But this is the worst I can say for Portal 2.  It's a triumph that exceeds the brilliance of the first game, and - with new mechanics and a new co-op mode - greatly expands the concept's potential.  I look forward to even more from the Portal franchise.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Portal>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Braid>, mechanically (though Portal is much funnier)

<i>Progress: Finished single-player and co-op</i>
