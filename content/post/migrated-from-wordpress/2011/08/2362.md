I actually tried to start playing this some months ago, and unfortunately I can't really muster up the interest to get back into it.  The new formula I saw in the early game is really cool, having more in common with <game:Assassin's Creed> than with the first [Sly Cooper](game:Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus) -- rather than discrete stages, the medium-scale "heist" takes place in an open area which also consists of sub-objectives and collectibles.  The overall structure seems pretty great, plus the game also appears to have addressed most of my mechanical complaints about its progenitor.  <i><b>But</b></i> the controls, in particular the camera controls, are just <i>too awkward</i>.

Which is a shame, because in 2004 this was probably perfectly adequate.  I've just completely missed the boat on this one.  Sorry Sly.
