It's pretty fun!  The presentation is stupendous -- a dark art style, mostly-vacant soundtrack, and finely tuned camera movement really reinforce a sense of foreboding tension in the bowels of the Shadow Planet.  It nails the feelings of isolation and exploration that most Metroid-likes shoot for, and ITSP's unique features - upgrades like a grabber claw and a buzzsaw - really differentiate it from its inspirations (unlike, say, <game:Shadow Complex>).

I do have one big concern though, in terms of game length.  After a little more than an hour I'm already <b>32\%</b> of the way through the campaign (and have 34\% of the map explored).  Given the game's pace so far, I don't know if it can really blow me away in the next 2-3 hours.
