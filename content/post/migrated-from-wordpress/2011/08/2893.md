I feel for the <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Indie Bundle</a> guys.  It's a good thing they're humble, because most of the bundled games aren't very good -- of course I enjoyed <game:VVVVVV>, and <game:Braid> which was in the last bundle, so I <i>already own those</i>.  And most of the others - <game:And Yet It Moves>, [Crayon Physics](game:Crayon Physics Deluxe), <game:Cogs>, <game:Machinarium>, <game:Osmos> - are games I've demo'd before, and just didn't find very interesting or good.  But I threw some money in for the charity angle, and Steel Storm was a pleasant surprise.

Not that's it's great: the gameplay is simple, the campaign difficulty spikes unexpectedly, and the level design is intensely repetitive.  But the bullet- and laser- and explosion-filled chaos makes for a pretty fun time, even when I'm dying as a result of it.

That being said, I don't know that I'll bother coming back to the game for Episode 2 ("Burning Retribution" proper), because even in the first episode's short campaign the primitive mechanics and lackluster level design got stale by the end.
