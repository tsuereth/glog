I didn't try the original <game:Deus Ex> until way too late, and as such its features and technology just didn't impress me.  The choice-heavy gameplay it pioneered has become <i>usual</i>, and its mechanics simply couldn't measure up to modern games.  But I can appreciate that, back in 2000, it would have been a pretty amazing experience.

So when I watch trailers and developer diaries for Human Revolution, and it looks <i>so good</i>, I really hope that it can live up to that idea of pushing the medium forward, again.  I am slightly worried, though, that it will just be a barely-playable mess, the latest in Eidos's and Square-Enix's last few years of overhyped AAA garbage.

Fingers crossed -- we'll find out on Tuesday.
