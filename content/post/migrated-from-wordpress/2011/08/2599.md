I know, I know, late to the party [again](game:Sly 2: Band of Thieves).  That may go some length toward explaining my lack of interest in Psychonauts.  Not unlike <game:BrÃ¼tal Legend> after it, Psychonauts has a really cool theme and some stellar writing, but the gameplay just isn't compelling at all -- with its boilerplate platforming mechanics and countless collectible pickups, this really just feels like yet another [Super Mario 64](game:Super Mario 64 DS) knockoff.  And while <game:Banjo-Kazooie> succeeded as a collect-a-thon with imaginative worlds and nonsensical items, it was also <i>brimming</i> with personality; Psychonauts has good characters, but the levels themselves just aren't very engaging.

And, again, maybe I would have been more tolerant of this in 2005.  But I simply don't have the patience anymore to wade through tepid, unusually-lengthy platforming in order to learn more about the game's clever world.
