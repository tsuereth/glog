Yesterday when I mentioned that I was putting "about" as much time as I could into [Human Revolution](game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution), this demo was what qualified the <i>about</i>.  The promotional media for Space Marine has made protagonist Captain Titus out to be the ultimate badass: covered in plate armor, bristling with heavy guns, waving around a <i>chainsaw sword</i>, and also, uh, <i>JETPACK</i>.  With all that pure, unadulterated kickass just bouncing around all willy-nilly, does it matter if the game is totally retarded?

Well, the demo doesn't make a great case for it.  It shows two levels -- one where you fight a bunch of orcs, then a bunch of orcs, then a bunch of orcs, then some orcs, then more orcs, then wave after wave after wave of orcs.  The level lasts less than half an hour, but becomes painfully repetitive almost immediately.  In the second level, you get a jetpack and can dive-bomb down into orcs, so basically the same thing but a lot shorter and easier.

The high concept still sounds amazing, so I'm not ready to write it completely off just yet.  But if the demo's level designs are really representative of the full game, I think I'll stick with <i>watching</i> it, rather than playing it.
