I still come back to TBOGT pretty frequently when I need a GTA fix.  Recently, I realized that the extra stuff to get 100% completion was actually fairly simple (at least compared to the ridiculous amount of pigeons, stunt jumps, and other crap in the base [GTA4](game:Grand Theft Auto IV)).  And, yeah, it was a relatively small <i>amount</i> of stuff, but the majority of it was pretty underwhelming as anything other than notches on the completion percentage.

The drug war missions were neat at first, but become intensely repetitive, since there are so few different mission types.  Base-jumping was surprisingly fun, but there are far too few of those, too.  The underground fighting matches got stupid once fighters started carrying weapons, and while the special club management missions are pretty cool, actually getting to them - by standing around and watching things for minutes at a time - is painfully boring.

I can't complain about the game's overall quality, given that the core campaign experience, and basic dicking around, is still <i>so fun</i>.  Nevertheless, it's hard not to hope that [GTA5](game:Grand Theft Auto V) will have more meaningful and entertaining extras.

And it's a <b>particularly</b> interesting situation in light of [Saints Row 3](game:Saints Row: The Third), given that Volition's franchise is <i>built</i> around those extra activities, and their third iteration <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eLwIRo1RYY">looks to have</a> a more engaging (if not serious) narrative than its predecessors.

<i>Progress: 100%</i>
