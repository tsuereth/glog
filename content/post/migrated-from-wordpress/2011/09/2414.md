If there were three words Square Enix could say to get me interested in Final Fantasy again, it would be "like {{% game "Chrono Trigger" %}}Chrono Trigger{{% /game %}}."  Which isn't, word for word, what <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/09/final-fantasy-xiii-2-time-travel">they are saying</a>, but it's close enough to catch my eye.
