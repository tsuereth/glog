I played the E3 demo of this very briefly, and I wasn't too impressed, because I only got up to two Kirbys at once -- while you're building up your Kirby army, it's really just a platformer with no particularly unique features.  But it looks like once you're running full-tilt, it could be a real blast.

Also, some of <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/09/03/kirby-mass-attack-minigames-feature-minis-games/">the minigames</a> look really awesome.
