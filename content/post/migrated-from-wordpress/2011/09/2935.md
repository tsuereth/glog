Oh, yeah, I lost my save file in an unfortunate data mishap.  But I was having a hard time getting back into Valkyrie Profile, anyway.

The mechanics are pretty cool: in addition to the battle stuff I've already mentioned, the platform-inspired dungeon layouts (with an ice crystal move that allows you to do some cool jumping tricks, and solve some other puzzles) are inspired, and not quite like anything else -- even to this day.

But having seen all this already, I'm having trouble motivating myself to push any farther into the game (or, at this point, going through the first few hours again).  Assuming I've seen all - or nearly all - of the neat mechanics Valkyrie Profile has to offer, even though the later game is sure to ramp up the challenge and make me learn how to master them, I'm not really sure what else I can look forward to.  Aside from wandering around the countryside, watching sepia-tinted cutscenes.

I guess that's it, really.  I like the idea of playing the game, but it's long-winded enough that it demands a certain patience of me, which I don't really have anymore.
