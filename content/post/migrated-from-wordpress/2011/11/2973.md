I would've felt pretty cheated if I'd bought this at full price.  The Path to War DLC includes three segments -- one reprise of a neat, but underwhelming flying-vehicle mission from the main game's campaign; one tank segment that, while explosive, isn't as good as the rest of the game's vehicle missions; and one on-foot sequence with a couple new weapons, which are, again, neat but not terribly satisfying.

Each of the missions is presented as a preface to Armageddon's terraformer prologue, so the narrative holds no surprises whatsoever, and they're not bound together in any meaningful way.  It comes across as more tech demo than game content.  But its "demo" is overshadowed by what was already in the main game.  What's the point?

<game:Red Faction: Armageddon> taught me that Volition can make a good PC game, and can make it well -- which made me a lot less worried about <game:Saints Row: The Third>.  But Path to War has taught me that they still don't understand how to make substantial DLC, which has me <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/11/10/thq-announces-the-first-saints-row-the-third-season-pass/">a little worried again</a>.

<b>Better than</b>: [Demons of the Badlands](game:Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Red Faction: Armageddon>  
<b>Admittedly, the Shard Gun</b>: is one of the industry's cooler [Gravity Gun](game:Half-Life 2) rip-offs, since it can <i>tear buildings apart</i>
