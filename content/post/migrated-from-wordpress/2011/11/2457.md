The controls/mechanics are pretty great, the weapons are awesome, and a good portion of the levels are a real blast, no pun intended.  In one of them, I piloted a spider walker with laser guns, which could also <i>walk through buildings</i>.  Red Faction: Armageddon speaks to an increased level of polish and sophistication on its {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}predecessor{{% /game %}} -- but, inexplicably, loses the biggest feature that made Guerrilla fun to play.

Armageddon has plenty of toys, but not much of a toybox to play with them in.  It's enough to string the one-dimensional story along, especially as it's interspersed with awesome vehicle segments, but ultimately I can't help but wonder... why?  The sandbox formula worked so well for Red Faction before; why replace it with this unremarkable linear campaign?

<b>Come fucking <i>on</i>, THQ</b>: <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/27/red-faction-franchise-wont-continue-in-any-meaningful-way/">canceling this franchise</a> is a retard move.  Just put explosives in an open world again.  Obvious!
