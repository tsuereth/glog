The "reactive narration" is <i>neat</i>, and the presentation in general - the polished art style and offbeat soundtrack - is fairly impressive.  As for the gameplay, it seems competent enough, but even in the 10(?)-minute demo it started to feel button-mashy and repetitive.  There are some interesting touches to the pure action gameplay, specifically a few level-ups and some equippable weapons and attributes, but that's about it.  Not to mention, given the amount of experience and story completion I saw in the demo, it also doesn't seem like there's much content in here at all.

It's a neat experiment, but I really don't feel compelled to see any more of it.
