As I've just written, <game:SpaceChem> can attribute its greatness largely to the depth and variety of its content.  The DLC expansion 63 Corvi serves as a prequel set of missions, which revolve around a new "Quantum Tunnel" puzzle piece: atoms can't be directly transported from the input side of the reactor to the output, so you must use the quantum tunnel to teleport atoms one by one.  This mechanic is used simply at first, but later puzzles combine it with arranging and bonding compounds, making SpaceChem's original challenges more complex.

It's a neat gimmick, but doesn't really have the depth that the core campaign's puzzles were able to go to.  Plus the final boss-battle stage is pretty dull, and the expansion's "story" doesn't really have any meat to it.

This is more SpaceChem, which is cool, but in the shadow of the main game's content it falls a little short.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Magicka: Vietnam>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness - Episode Two>  
<b>For a free prize from the Steam Summer Sale, pretty cool</b>: but for money, given you already own SpaceChem (which includes ResearchNet), you could really take it or leave it
