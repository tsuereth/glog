My first thoughts on booting the game up were, "Huh, arcade mode?  Multiplayer achievements?  Odd, for a game that appears in trailers to be inspired by {{% game "Metroid" %}}Metroid{{% /game %}}."  It turns out that Capsized is more like Metroid <i>without</i> all the parts I would consider emblematic of that franchise.  No ponderous and labyrinthine world map, no permanent weapon and ability upgrades - but there is a <i>lot</i> of shooting at alien enemies, and some light physics-puzzling.  The speed of the game makes it obvious that this is, in fact, built for multiplayer combat action.

That's nice and all, and the action isn't terrible, but the heavy combat emphasis just isn't what I expected or wanted.
