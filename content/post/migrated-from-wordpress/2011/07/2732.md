Hamilton's Great Adventure is definitely <i>aesthetically</i> interesting -- the art style is pretty cool, and the audio visual polish is well above the norm for a smaller/independent project.  But beyond that I can't really find anything good here.

The gameplay is mechanically promising - solving the puzzle of getting to the level's exit - but in the levels I played, it was just <i>absurdly</i> easy.  Even the bonus level I did (for the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/summersale">summer sale ticket</a>) was only challenging because the level scenery and camera perspective were always in my way.  There are also some real-time action elements, but their rarity and insignificance make their inclusion more baffling than enticing.

The narrative trappings are throw-away, with a plot that's already strikingly stupid (some kind of Crystal Skull bullshit), and lazy storytelling which really doesn't help the situation at all.

<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-06-03-download-games-roundup-review?page=3">Eurogamer</a> implies that the game's difficulty could get more satisfying later on, but the early levels set the bar <i>so low</i> that I simply can't get excited about making progress.
