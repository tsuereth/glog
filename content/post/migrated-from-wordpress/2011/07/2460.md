Unlike {{% game "SpaceChem" %}}SpaceChem{{% /game %}} - which egged me on with continually-fresh mechanics, rich puzzle content, and genuinely satisfying difficulty - there's really nothing pulling me back into Rush.  And being so short, it's not like I'm missing much by completely losing interest.
