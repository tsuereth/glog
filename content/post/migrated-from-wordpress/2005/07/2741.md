A collection of large, interconnected game worlds gives Amazing Mirror a very <i><game:Metroid></i>-like feel, which is good.  The immersive game world isn't the only new feature: there isn't just one Kirby, but four.  In a usual game, the player will take pink Kirby off adventuring, and the other three will meander around, probably getting themselves killed.  But you can call them to your aid, either to solve a puzzle that requires them or just to give a boss a hard time.  Multiple players can split the control of the Kirbies, if you're so inclined.

There are also a few new abilities, like a UFO, and Smash (which replicates Kirby's moves from <game:Super Smash Bros.>).  It's also got a handful of minigames, and replay-intensive collectible items to keep the fun going for at least a little while longer.  It's a fairly short game, but incredibly fun while it lasts.

<i>Progress: Complete</i>
