A somewhat immortal RPG, FF7 stands out for its epic qualities: simple but fun combat mechanics, action-packed battle sequences, and most of all, a lengthy, engrossing storyline.  Forgiving translation error, FF7 is a tour de force with immersion to spare, and plenty of variety (unique settings, minigames, et al) to keep the player engaged.  It may not have an incredibly innovative battle system, but this is the game that proved people could care about video game characters.
