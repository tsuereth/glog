The writing is brilliant (humor is excellently Americanized and nothing is dumbed down, and the characters are hilariously designed, from the bumbling gumshoe to a particular witness who sp33ks in l33t). The gameplay isn't timing-oriented, but rather than just making it easy, this thinking-man's game makes you ... well, think about what decisions to make. The game consists of two base parts, investigating crime scenes (think a Lucasarts-style point-and-click adventure), and cross-examinations in court (deciding where/how to question a witness and what evidence to present when relevant). Seeing prosecutor Miles Edgeworth physically recoil as if punched in the gut when Phoenix successfully catches his witness in a lie is perhaps one of the best video game moments ever.
