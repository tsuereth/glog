One of the more celebrated SNES-era RPGs. As I presumed when I had just started playing, the combat system never gets particularly deep and the enemies are rarely hard. However, the dungeon design is very good and the puzzles are top-notch. Personally I think the game would have been better off Zelda-style, eschewing the RPG elements wholly. At any rate it's a fun 25-ish-hour jaunt through yesteryear.
