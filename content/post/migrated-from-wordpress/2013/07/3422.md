Oh, I like creative games alright.  But I just don't ... <i>get</i> Starseed Pilgrim.  I mean, I pretty much understand how the game is played (thanks to about fifteen minutes of flailing around, and some internet research).  But other than that mystery - that is, once you've figured out Starseed Pilgrim's mechanics - I don't get why I should keep playing it.  The game itself, with all its unguided randomness and repetition, doesn't give me any sense of fulfillment.

This is definitely one of those games that <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/24">isn't "for" me</a>.
