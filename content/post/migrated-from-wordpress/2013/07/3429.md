<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/07/30/bioshock-infinite-clash-in-the-clouds-out-today/">Clash in the Clouds</a>?  Whatever, man.  I could continue not-caring about that with both hands tied behind my back.  The <i>real</i> DLC, though; <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/07/30/bioshock-infinite-returns-to-rapture-in-burial-at-sea/">this</a> is very much in line with my particular interests.  The Season Pass feels like a much less idiotic purchase, now.
