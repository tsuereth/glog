Offspring Fling keeps changing up its obstacles and puzzle strategies, all the way to the end -- with challenges that range from taking your time to decode a level's obstacles, to executing perfect sequences and (less frequently) badass aerial maneuvers in real-time.  These 100 stages are short, and rarely super-difficult, but sport a really impressive variety of puzzle concepts.  Of course, the <i>real</i> challenge is getting gold and rainbow flowers, by beating expert and developer times, respectively.  I'm plenty satisfied just finishing the puzzles though.

Well... evidently, some bonus levels unlock when you beat those special times.  But that's fine.  I'm good with the 100 levels.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "1000 Amps" %}}1000 Amps{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "VVVVVV" %}}VVVVVV{{% /game %}}  
<b>Oh yeah</b>: this was from the guy who made {{% game "Depict1" %}}Depict1{{% /game %}} also.  I'll get back to {{% game "Snapshot" %}}Snapshot{{% /game %}}, one of these days.

<i>Progress: 100 levels complete, 18 gold flowers, 1 rainbow flower -- 33.1%.</i>
