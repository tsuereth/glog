To its credit, Proteus has some pretty cool world-building technology: procedurally assembling a low-res game world with wildlife and weather effects.

On the other hand, <game:Minecraft: Java Edition> also does <i>all</i> of this, in addition to having a <b>game</b> in that world.  Proteus has no such game.  The most you can do is watch said wildlife and weather take place in the world, as in-game time passes by.

To judge Proteus as "good" or "bad" incorrectly presumes that there is some content to pass judgment on.  (Which won't stop me from giving it a terrible rating.)  There's nothing <i>in</i> Proteus.  It's an environment engine; a single component of a theoretical game.  Without any other components, it's just pointless.

<b>Better than</b>: ...  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Dear Esther>, going outside.  
<b>I guess there is an "ending"</b>: but I didn't <i>walk around</i> enough to trigger it.

<i>Progress: is there such a thing?</i>
