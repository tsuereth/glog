I didn't expect much from Sniper: Ghost Warrior, and that's basically what I got.  I was a little surprised - although in retrospect, I really shouldn't have been - that the game feels less like a day in the life of a sniper, and more like a budget FPS with most of the weapons removed.  Actually, you do still get a combat rifle and some throwing knives, for more intimate combat situations (which helps work around the shoddy stealth mechanics).  Anyway; you're really better off just playing any other shooter, and using a sniper rifle in it.
