The Assassin's Creed series has spent years now trading in its stealth for high-action, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that Black Flag is <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/20/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-ships-out-e3-trailer-with-develop/">so Bruckheimer-esque</a>.  The preview, at least, is highly characterized by rapid gunplay, hectic naval warfare, and a general proliferation of <i>EXPLOSIONS</i>.  So, no, I have no complaints about this -- looks pretty fuckin' rad.
