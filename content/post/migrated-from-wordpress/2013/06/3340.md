I really, really, <i>really</i> like most of the core gameplay mechanics in FTL: exploring space, encountering Star Trek scenarios, fighting enemy ships (with ship system micromanagement!), and upgrading your vessel.  All of this stuff is firmly within my interests.  But I extremely, <i>intensely</i> dislike FTL's roguelike aspects.  The game wants to kill you, all the time, in as many ways as possible -- running out of fuel, running out of missiles, running out of <b>crew members</b>, and being blind-sided by surprisingly powerful foes.  And when you die, it's over: your ship is gone for good.  So much for investigating that ancient alien lifeform you resurrected.

Even on Easy mode, the game doesn't hesitate to throw piles of noxious shit at you with no warning.  I got pretty close to the end in my last play session; then I encountered a <i>cloaked</i> ship, meaning I couldn't even target it as my own ship was swiftly perforated.

If FTL wasn't made in the roguelike model, I would be absolutely in love with it.  But it doesn't seem to <i>want</i> me to enjoy it.  So ... meh.  Have it your way, FTL.
