As if I wasn't already sold on it, the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/11/ps4-media-blowout-driveclub-knack-infamous-second-son-and-mor/">Watch Dogs footage</a> from Sony's E3 presentation definitely has me interested.  Although I must admit some apprehensive curiosity regarding - what appears to be - an online gameplay link to a phone/tablet companion app.  Fingers crossed that I won't have to rely on some random mobile player to get me out of a jam.
