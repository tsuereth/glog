Well, to keep this brief -- <game:Tomb Raider (2013)> got me legit interested in the franchise, but my foray into Lara's previous reboot wasn't quite as pleasant.  While I was pretty impressed with Tomb Raider: Legend's visual polish - particularly some forward-thinking settings that allow modern PCs to make it look far better than a game from 2006 should - the play mechanics of clambering up ledges, and targeting and shooting bad things, are old and clunky.

It's surprisingly not-bad, but still not good enough to compete with current action/adventure sensibilities.
