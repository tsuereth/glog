The Last Guardian was already on the edge of the knife when <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/12/13/sony-confirms-uedas-departure-the-last-guardian-to-be-complete/">Ueda went rogue</a>, but whatever <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/13/the-last-guardian-still-under-uedas-creative-supervision-sti/">hope</a> it had left is sure gone now, with Sony using the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/11/the-last-guardian-is-on-hiatus/">magic words</a> that mean we'll probably never see it again.  If I was a betting man, I'd put money on Team Ico falling back to a pocket-sized Vita project, before fading into legend forever.
