The end of the game drags on - just a little - but it also features some joyously technical level-design puzzles, and a satisfying final boss.  Ultimately I still feel a bit disappointed in Anodyne's movement and control-precision issues, which really only get smoothed over by a large health bar to compensate for mistakes; but it's a fun trip, and a remarkable achievement for its two-man team.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:LostWinds>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Fez>  
<b>Maybe equitably good as</b>: <game:1000 Amps>, but spread out over a lengthier game.

<i>Progress: Finished, 37 cards.</i>
