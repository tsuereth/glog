Coming back to <game:Magicka> after so long, it's refreshing to hurl fire lasers and explode lightning shields out at goblins again.  But being one-shotted by an overpowered enemy is no less aggravating than it used to be, even with the one-free-revive fairy that The Stars are Left comes with.

It's not that my wizard's swift, grisly death is itself a frustration; actually, this is one of the things that makes Magicka so cool.  But as in the original adventure, death takes a significant toll on game progress -- if not with far-removed checkpoints, then with magic-sponge enemies (in my case, a boss) that simply have way too many health points.  Having to fight for minutes at a time, when a <i>single</i> mistake can kill you and force you to restart, isn't that fun.

Okay, so with the fairy, it's two mistakes.  Still.
