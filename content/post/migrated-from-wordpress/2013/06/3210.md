The <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/10362-Remember-Me-Review-Sadly-Forgettable">reviews</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/03/remember-me-review/">are</a> <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/bb5cd3/remember-me-review">in</a>, and the news is ... not great.  Despite the game's lofty ambitions, there's a consensus that Remember Me's most interesting parts - the memory remixing sequences, which look unique, if a bit undercooked - can't distract from the bland combat that makes up the majority of its playtime; that the customization element doesn't really matter, since the moves you can "customize" are themselves so rote.  And that the Neo Paris backdrop is somewhere between silly and crazy.  Which isn't a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/06/try-to-ignore-the-dialogue-in-this-exciting-remember-me-clip/">huge surprise</a>.  Still, a shame -- if the memory remixing was the core feature of a smaller, independently produced game, it probably could have gotten away without having a big dumb combat system chained to it.
