Sure, strategy games get a lot of their flavor from complexity -- especially turn-based games, which tend toward throwing huge piles of mechanics at the player.  This is exactly what I find appealing about [Civilization V](game:Sid Meier's Civilization V): the balance between technological progress, army strength, ally diplomacy, trade agreements, and everything else the game has going on.  But everyone has their limit, and Crusader Kings II is way, <i>way</i> beyond mine.  The in-game tutorial is really more of a PowerPoint presentation, clicking through pop-up information windows and tooltips, describing the seemingly endless amount of information that makes up - what appears to be - the game's "gameplay."  I know I frequently claim that I don't have the patience to wait for a game to get good, but this time, I don't have the patience to learn what the hell the game <i>is</i>.

When a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gke4pJ5OtIQ">PC Gamer editor says</a>, "I was still finding out about core mechanics I had completely overlooked at 200, 210, 220 hours in ..." -- yeah.  No thanks.

<i>Progress: Didn't even make it through the tutorial.</i>
