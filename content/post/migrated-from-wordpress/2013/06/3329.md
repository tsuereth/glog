McPixel is completely, utterly, and irredeemably stupid.  It's just <i>dumb</i>.  McPixel is the worst parts of old-school point-and-click adventure games - pixel hunting, and backwards-ass illogical puzzles - peppered with Looney Tunes-caliber slapstick humor, and wrapped in a 20-second time limit.  Theoretically the game's lack of sensible structure might be justified by its comedic value, but it isn't creative enough for this crutch, either: once you've seen one dynamite-pratfall or crotch-kick, you've seen them all.

That it was the <i>first</i> game <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/26/mcpixel-is-the-first-greenlight-game-available-on-steam/">greenlit</a> by the Steam community, should be a source of shame to us all.
