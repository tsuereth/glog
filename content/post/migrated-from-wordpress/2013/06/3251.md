This wasn't the first time The Internet tricked me into trying to make Just Cause 2 fun, but hopefully it'll be the last.  I need to remember this time.  I need to remember...

I know that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JC2/">people love this game</a>, and I've come to accept that.  I know that the game is capable of some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TvKUjgE6y8#t=30s">really, actually awesome shit</a>, and I'm OK with that.  And I know that the story is <i>supposed</i> to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyy7tSigAyU">completely stupid</a>, or, it isn't supposed to but it doesn't matter, and I think I understand that.  But Just Cause 2 just isn't good enough!  Its controls are a mess.  Its world map is borderline unnavigable.  Just the simplest acts, of shooting, of driving, of <i>walking</i>, all feel wrong.

Really, I'm jealous of the extreme physics stunts that JC2 is capable of; I wish that Grand Theft Auto had fuller and more-modern aerobatics (which [GTA5](game:Grand Theft Auto V) should), or that Saints Row had a more terrestrially-interesting landscape (which [SR4](game:Saints Row IV) ... probably won't).  Maybe [Mad Max](game:Mad Max (2015))'s themes will <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/06/13/mad-max-gets-behind-the-wheel-of-avalanches-open-world-wastelan/">play better</a> to Avalanche's style, but I'm not getting my hopes up yet.
