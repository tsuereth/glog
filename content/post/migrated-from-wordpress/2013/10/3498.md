[Warlock](game:Warlock: Master of the Arcane) was a fun trip, but my interest in it waned in the face of balance issues and technical stumbles.  If the upcoming sequel is going to hold my attention for more than a few days, it'll need some polish; but in the meantime, Paradox's <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/04/paradox-interactive-reveals-warlock-2-the-exiled/">great sense of trailer-humor</a> at least has me curious.
