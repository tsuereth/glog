I would absolutely <i>love</i> for Black Flag to be a game about pirates, and throw all that Assassin/Templar crap away.  So I hope Ubisoft isn't just <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/30/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-sets-sail-for-pc-on-november-19/">teasing me</a> with this promo attitude.  Will this finally be it?  The Assassin's Creed game that finally cuts out the modern-day story completely?  Here's hoping.
