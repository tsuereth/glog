Well, the good news is that the bloom lighting isn't as pervasive and offensive as it <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/11/zelda-wind-waker-hd-graphics-compared-to-gamecube-version/">previously appeared</a>.  The bad news is that, instead, <b>soft</b> lighting gets in the way of Wind Waker's signature look; when flickering torches cast realistically-graded shadows on Link's cap, it just doesn't look like a cartoon anymore.  It's a shame that this otherwise-admirable technology detracts from the game's aesthetic.

But the <i>better</i> news is that this game is still, very much, [The Wind Waker](game:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker).  The intuitive mechanics, the expressive characters, and the childlike sense of wonder are all still here.  There are so many moments in this game that have been strongly etched into my memory; I can't wait to visit the rest of them.
