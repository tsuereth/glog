As far as I know, the only reason I haven't made the "Tower" rating yet is because I haven't been able to sustain the necessary population count for it (I can go over it at times, depending on lunchtime rush and hotel occupancy, but never for more than a whole day).  My tower is already 100 floors of fully-built space, so the only non-destructive way I have to lure more people in is to fix low ratings, and since I've also maxed out my tower's elevator shafts (elevator wait times clearly being the source of most complaints), the only non-destructive way to do this is to lower rents.  There is a save-data hack tool for SimTower that is supposedly able to batch-edit rent settings, but I can't get it to work under wine.

Which is a long-winded way of saying I give up.  But it was fun while it lasted.
