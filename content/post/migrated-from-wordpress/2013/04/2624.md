There are a litany of nitpicky complaints you can lodge against LEGO City Undercover -- but offhand, I can't remember any of them.  (Well, there's the ridiculous loading times.  And the occasionally-disastrous camera.  But I digress.)  The simple joys of exploring LEGO City, and collecting items by solving minor mysteries or destroying LEGO shit, outweigh those issues.

I wish it had been easier to race through the campaign and get all the costume abilities, because without them, you really can't appreciate all the options the city itself affords.
