The amount and quality of content in Captain Scarlett is just, really just commendable.  In an industry filled with cop-out DLCs that do nothing but grift more money from loyal customers, this pack makes the case for meaningfully extending the game experience, with both an amusing story and a solid collection of additional quests.

Other than the slightly-disappointing ending, this is a real winner.  If you've enjoyed <game:Borderlands 2> and want some more of it, this is exactly perfect.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony>  
<b>Word of caution</b>: Just because the quest log <i>says</i> the Hyperius quest is level 30-something, doesn't mean you can solo it at 30-something.  Dude has a lot of HPs!

<i>Progress: Finished everything except Hyperius</i>
