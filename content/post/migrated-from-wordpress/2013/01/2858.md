Maybe it's just because of the surprising number of level 50, team-oriented quests, but the Campaign of Carnage seems a bit lacking in quest count as compared to [Captain Scarlett](game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty).  Nevertheless, this DLC pack's personality and charm makes it well worthwhile, even for the solo player.
