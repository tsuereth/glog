Unlike <game:Torchlight II>, Borderlands 2 is something that I can - and will - be revisiting on my own.  That, to me, is the greatest victory in this sequel: that it's even fun to play solo.  Maybe it's the robots.

That said, I've already conquered almost all of the main game's content, with the exception of the level-holy-fuck raid-boss.  So it's a good thing that Gearbox is still <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2012/12/20/sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt-dlc-sets-off-for-borderlands-2-ja/">pushing new DLC out</a>.
