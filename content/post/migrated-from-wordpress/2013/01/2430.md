Make no mistake: none of the items included in the Basement Collection are substantial or polished enough to be released on their own.  So it's hard to get too attached to any single one.  But from the blissful tale of Aether to the darker shades of Coil, from the nigh-unplayable Triachnid experiment to the Meat Boy prototype's flashes of brilliance, there is something of value throughout the collection's offerings, even if none of them are really individually successful.

And Edmund's platformers are still way too hard for me.  I just don't have the reflexes for them.  Which is a shame, because Spewer and Time Fcuk are otherwise pretty fun.
