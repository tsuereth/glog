I may return to this godforsaken desert eventually, but it's wholly dependent upon getting people together.  For all the mechanical and technical ways in which Torchlight II betters its Goliath of a rival, it still can't rival Diablo III's intensity and <i>bombast</i>.  And while on paper, TL2's replayability dwarfs Blizzard's depressingly-anemic endgame, after enough levels it starts to feel samey and unengaging.

Except with a party, of course.  And even though Runic hasn't done a perfect job in regard to multiplayer - latency can make the game a nightmare, some network configurations induce an invisible player limit, and the game browser could use more focus on finding your friends - it certainly puts Battle.net to shame.

<b>Still worth it though</b>: if you're addicted to the genre, or have a team to play with.
