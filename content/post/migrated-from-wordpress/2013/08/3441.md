When I'm actually playing Darksiders II, it <i>feels</i> pretty good: the controls are tight, and the world (at least, the parts with things in them) is fun to roam around in.  The problem is that, when I'm <i>not</i> playing it - which is almost all the time - I feel almost no compulsion to return.

The game's hooks seem weak.  I don't care about the story.  The dungeons (thus far) aren't exciting, ditto for the world map.  Combat feels repetitive.  And the equipment system is kind of shallow.  Really, when I think about it, what's most appealing about Darksiders II is its presentation: gorgeous graphics, superb art, and an incredibly moody soundtrack.  I like "being" in the game's world, but not really any of the things I'm doing in it.

While it's unquestionable that Death's adventure is a mechanical and technical improvement over {{% game "Darksiders" %}}his brother's{{% /game %}}, I've yet to encounter an item, dungeon puzzle, or narrative element that really <i>wows</i> me.  I'll try to find one, at least for a little while longer.
