I've got a gun that's a cat holding another gun.  Two cat-guns, in fact.  Miniguns, SWAT shotguns, sniper and assault rifles, a magnum bigger than my character's torso -- just, a completely silly arsenal in my stores.  Mercenary Kings has applied the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinner_box">Skinner box</a> concept to <i>guns</i>, and I don't think it could possibly have gone better.

I have to stop.  I'm addicted to collecting crafting materials, to build <b>more guns</b> (and more bionic mods, and more <i>knives</i>).  Which sucks because, in its Early Access state - with only 60 of its 100 planned missions - Mercenary Kings doesn't <i>have</i> all the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=164034416#117052">materials to build these things</a>.

When it does, I'll definitely be back in it.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Castle Crashers" %}}Castle Crashers{{% /game %}} (because it's <i>still fun by myself!</i>)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: ... {{% game "Braid" %}}Braid{{% /game %}}, I guess?  In its class, this game is just the best.  
<b>Seriously</b>: there are <i>two</i> guns that are cats.  A shotgun and a burst-fire rifle.  The cats are different colors.

<i>Progress: Finished the Early Access missions, collected like ... a fuckton of guns.</i>
