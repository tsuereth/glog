All too often, I find that a game I enjoy in multiplayer/party settings becomes a tired chore when approached solo.  Not so for Mercenary Kings.  Going alone, the game transforms from a chaotic free-for-all into a Rambo-esque power fantasy, wherein I wipe out entire installations of bad dudes (and bad robots) with increasingly-ludicrous weaponry.

My newest construction is a submachine gun that shoots homing missiles.

Even with recycled environments and enemies, the game manages to keep up the illusion of variety: every return trip to a level sees a new section unlocked, a new objective to find, or a new boss to fight.  Most missions are rapid and tightly paced, expertly encouraging "just one more" run.  And there's always, <i>always</i> more crafting loot to collect.

Like a 2D [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim), Mercenary Kings' technical shortcomings feel like they don't even matter.  This game is damn fun.
