A few years ago, I wouldn't really have considered such a situation possible -- that I would be disinterested in a Blizzard game.  Yet here we are, announcing an expansion to <game:Diablo III>, with the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/08/21/blizzard-debuts-diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-opening-cinematic/">Angel of Death</a> kicking some shit; and all I can say is "meh."  The core game's abject laziness in content design and storytelling just doesn't leave me with any excitement for more.
