To be fair, by <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified">all accounts</a> the game actually turned out to be pretty playable for someone who's into XCOM.  I'm not one of those people, though; I was more interested in a <game:Mass Effect>-style adventure than in something that required real team-positioning tactics.  (I got a free copy of <game:XCOM: Enemy Unknown> with my <game:BioShock Infinite> pre-order, and frankly I don't know what I'm going to do with it.)

What is terribly surprising - or at least, disappointing - given the promotional campaign's heavy narrative focus, is that reviews seem to agree on how poorly-written and lackluster the story is.  I've seen some footage.  This is bush-league stuff.

What I really wanted to see out of The Bureau, and what would have made me super stoked for it, was <i>either</i> a sci-fi adventure or an authentically-styled 60's-era sci-fi story.  The reviews suggest that what's come out instead is a real-time XCOM game.  That's all well and good if you actually care about XCOM, I guess.  They can keep it.
