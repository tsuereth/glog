Hello again, world.

I got fed up with my own inaction on the custom-software Glog, so this is its WordPress replacement.  I've migrated nine years (!?) of my old posts into it, and although Neo Glog and Glog Classic don't have total feature parity, I'm calling this "good enough."  Going forward, I suspect that I may use this blog for other, non-video-game content as well -- but probably not very much.

If you're one of the approximately zero other people who used the old Glog, and you want to recover your old posts, you can download a flat-file, human-readable backup archive [HERE]($SiteBaseURL$wp-content/uploads/2013/05/glog.bak_.zip).  Posts and their comments are merged into plaintext files.

Excelsior!
