Back in 2001, a {{% abslink href="2011/06/25/saints-row-the-third-8/" %}}particular promo video{{% /abslink %}} for <game:Saints Row: The Third> - involving VTOL jets and microwave laser guns - really got me interested.  Of course, I was already very "interested" in SR4 -- but concerned of the potential for Deep Silver, a known purveyor of garbage, to piss in Volition's corn flakes.

That's where <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/09/saints-row-4s-pax-east-presentation-dubstep-gun/">this video</a> comes in.  Concerns assuaged.  I don't care if this is really just SR3 with new features and content; I am <i>awesome</i> with that.
