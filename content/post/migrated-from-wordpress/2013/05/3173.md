Yeah, I mean, it definitely draws from the same well as <game:Portal>.  But Quantum Conundrum has a unique flavor, not only due to its mansion/laboratory setting and less-hostile voice-over, but largely because of an increased focus on platforming and real-time puzzles.  It's less planning- and more execution-intensive than its sibling, which is ... something, I guess.  I dunno, I personally don't care as much for that kind of puzzle.  And the game's personality, from the sometimes too-hammy Professor to the repetitive death messages, falls a bit flat as well.

But the puzzle complexity seems to be ramping up nicely, and I am looking forward to wandering around ever more elaborate puzzle rooms.  I've only gotten to use two of the game's four alternate dimensions so far, so there should be plenty more ridiculous contrivances left to discover.
