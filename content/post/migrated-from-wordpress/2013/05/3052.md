I've been looking forward to 2K's XCOM reboot/spinoff (bootoff?) since before <game:XCOM: Enemy Unknown> was even a thing, and I still am -- as a <game:Mass Effect>-y take on a Cold War-era alien invasion, I feel like there's a lot of potential.  And as far as I can tell, this idea is still intact in the game's rebranding as "The Bureau."  But what strikes me as - not necessarily worrying, but <i>odd</i> - about the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/26/xcom-shooter-now-the-bureau-xcom-declassified-out-august/">recent</a> <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/13/being-a-bureau-dude-in-xcom-declassified/">trailers</a> is the overwhelming focus on government secrets and classified information.  If this is a hint at a deep and convoluted story, great!  But it's a totally unexpected angle, given that the game was previously "about" going all-out on aliens and their weird technology.

I guess, the concern in the back of my head is that this is an empty marketing gesture, like the dramatic slow-mo trailers that led up to <game:Dead Island>.  If the classified-info angle isn't, in fact, reflected in the game - that is, if 2K has decided to market The Bureau based on the hypothetical allure of its setting, rather than on the game's actual content - then that means they can't have much confidence in the game itself.  Which wouldn't be a huge surprise for a project in development over seven years and three studios.
