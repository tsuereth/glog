I haven't played Borderlands 2's psycho, Krieg, just yet; and I likely won't dust off the game again until the next DLC, [Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep](game:Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep).  But this <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/31/borderlands-2-krieg-short-is-the-shiniest-meat-bicycle/">powerful, beautiful vignette</a> is a fine example of how to promote a game.  Well done, Gearbox.
