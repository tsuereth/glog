It figuratively kills me to say this, but [The Tyranny of King Washington](game:Assassin's Creed III: The Tyranny of King Washington)'s final chapter "The Redemption" <i>does</i> redeem the DLC as a meaningful addition to <game:Assassin's Creed III>.  It does this in two general ways -- first, it includes more of the content that made the core game experience great: a naval warfare mission, and a mission to do odd liberation tasks around New York.  Second, it polishes the Tyranny formula thus far: not only adding a new, cool spirit animal power - a Bear Stomp which allows you to blow away nearby enemies, and damage fragile structures - but also implementing more finely-tuned opportunities for using last chapter ("The Betrayal")'s Eagle Flight power.  This is easily the best iteration of AC3's DLC adventure.

And - in a series <i>first</i> - this adventure has a <b>good ending</b>.  The whole story is totally divorced from the modern-day Desmond plot, which is helpful; but it actually ends up relating to the core game's plot in a really fascinating and informative way.

>!Also, King Washington is building a motherfucking <i>pyramid</i>, so the environment design around it feels all kinds of badass.!<

Really, The Redemption's only significant downfall is that it isn't as varied and content-rich as the core game.  So considering it's DLC, that's pretty good!

<b>Better than</b>: the previous Infamy and Betrayal chapters of <game:Assassin's Creed III: The Tyranny of King Washington>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Assassin's Creed III>  
<b>I dunno if this is possible, but</b>: if it <i>is</i> possible to buy The Redemption and skip the previous two Tyranny episodes, that would really be my recommendation.  (Given that, you might be a bit lost using the Wolf and Eagle powers.)

<i>Progress: Finished campaign, 62% Tyranny of King Washington completion.</i>
