Even in its optional extras, Arkham Origins sits contentedly in the shadow of [its forebear](game:Batman: Arkham City).  At their best, this game's investigative sidequests can about measure up to Arkham City's average level of quality; at their worst (which is most of them), they're just stilted sessions of connect-the-dots that barely even bother with narrative framing.  Tragically, one of the most fascinating extras - the story of Cyrus Pinkley - doesn't get marked on the map, so you're likely to miss it completely unless you ask The Internet.

And for the sake of tradition, if nothing else, Origins even goes so far as to include a ridiculous number of Riddler collectibles.  Ultimately the reward is (according to tradition) an empty disappointment, although also somewhat hilarious when taken in the context of the series.

As before: Arkham Origins is "good enough."  For now, at least.

<i>Progress: Finished all the sidequests and got all the collectibles (except some of Anarky's bullshit graffiti tags).</i>
