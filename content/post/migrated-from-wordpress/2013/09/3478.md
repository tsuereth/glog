As stoked as I am for the return of <game:Assassin's Creed III>'s polished mechanics, and what amounts to a realistic, Caribbean spin on [Wind Waker](game:The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker), this new <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/12/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-trailer-shows-tech-under-the-deck/">technology trailer</a> has me <i>even more</i> pumped for Black Flag -- and for games beyond it.  Between the real-time lighting techniques and the engine's capabiilty to assemble <i>moving parts</i> into a navigable, AI-traversable level, AnvilNext is setting some very exciting stages for Ubisoft games in the coming hardware generation.
