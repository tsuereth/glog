The best parts of [Sonic Adventure](game:Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut) were the parts that <i>weren't like</i> other Sonic games -- well, not that the treasure hunting was any good, but: the open-world exploration, and mixed-up mechanics like E-102 Gamma's shooting galleries, gave Sonic all new flavors that really enhanced the experience.

Which is why it's such a tragic comedy that only now, <b>15 years later</b>, Sonic Lost World is finally <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/25/sonic-lost-world-video-preview/">lessening the focus</a> on Sonic's speediness, in favor of thoughtful level design.  Whether they can do it well is yet to be determined, but the attempt, at least, is encouraging.
