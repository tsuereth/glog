I've got a little downtime before this month's big [Wiilease](game:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess), so I figured I'd start replaying CT for old time's sake.

So far, it's every bit as sophisticated and charming as I remember.  I will say that the battles seem to be slower than I'd like, but I'm pretty sure this is just because I'm still in the early stages of the game.

Gato rules!
