I'll be honest: the intro section bored me.  Link's humdrum little farming village is pretty bland, and unfortunately you have to spend some time in it getting used to the controls.  But now that I'm in the real adventure of the game, it's nothing short of exhilirating.  I only stopped playing because I haven't eaten since this morning.

Of course there is still a long way to go, but I have an extremely good feeling about this one.
