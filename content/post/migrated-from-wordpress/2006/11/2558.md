In previous playthroughs, I had never really concerned myself with checking out multiple endings, but I made that a focus of my CT romps over the weekend and I really enjoyed it.  It's remarkable how much refinement and polish was put into this little gem - I've fallen in love with it all over again.  But, [times are tough](game:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess), so getting all that's left will have to wait.
