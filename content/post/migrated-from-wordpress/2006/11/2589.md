The ending?  Pretty bizarre.  But that falls perfectly into line with the rest of the story.  It also leaves a ton of doors open for the <a href="http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q2-2006/052406a.html">sequel</a>.

Nothing about my previous complaint (far-off level-up abilities) has changed, except my opinion about it.  Finishing the game without them is perfectly feasible and fun, and having ultra-lofty goals for character advancement is a great replay mechanic.  Leveling up your bevy of cool abilities is a fantastic way to breathe life into the game well after the ending (not to mention all the sidequests).  I don't have the space in my schedule for it now, but I definitely plan on coming back to do more in the post-game when I get the chance.

I have a hard time quantifying it, but there's an immense sense of nostalgia when I play Contact.  It probably has more than a little to do with the SNES-esque graphical style prevalent in the Professor's lab, but there is definitely something very "old school" about Contact's gameplay mechanics.  A <b>huge</b> amount of credit should go to this game's developers for a job very well done.
