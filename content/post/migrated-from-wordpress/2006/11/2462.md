My statements about post-game collectibles may have been slightly exaggerated.  Though Twilight Princess is significantly long, the vast majority of that game length is the core game - questing around, solving dungeons, felling boss monsters.  Personally I don't see anything wrong with that, since there is still as much to do outside the game as your average Zelda, maybe slightly more since this time around there are 5 heart pieces to a container.

There are some things with the game that could be improved upon, to be sure; for instance, after the first dungeon, there is a complete flood of rupees, filling Link's pockets before you know what's happening.  And some methods of speedy transportation come <i>long</i> after they would be considered useful.  But in spite of these, Twilight Princess is an amazingly epic adventure and wildly great fun to play.  (See previous statements.)
