I decided that returning to Contact and buffing up Terry's stats would be a good way to wind myself down from the Zelda high.  There's a trick with a particularly powerful cow that you can use to max weapon skills easily, but other things like defensive and magic attributes can be somewhat laborious.

It isn't immediately apparent, but a lot of content opens up after the ending of the game.  There's a lot of mystery about Contact even now, but it's highly suggested that you explore everywhere and talk to every NPC you can.  Exploration is something I dig, though I've already been everywhere, so it could be seen as a little monotonous.

Thusly the replay value isn't quite all I had cracked it up to be; but it's still pretty fun.
