Though I have always been - and still am - pretty terrible at strategery, Fire Emblem is a series I have always wanted to try, and Path of Radiance has recently (through gift-giving) become very accessible.

I started on Easy mode, and so despite my lack of ability, it is very not-hard.  So, when I eventually finish I suppose I should give it another go in Normal mode.  The story is so far intriguing, though there is still a long way to go, and the gameplay is more complex (= good) than I expected given the nature of the combat.  There is considerable customization and variation in the equipment and classes.

One of the game's biggest victories is making itself simple to understand, despite the depth and breadth of what is going on in a battle.  More advanced options are introduced at a comfortable pace as the game goes on.  Looking good so far.
