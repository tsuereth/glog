Samus Aran's morph ball mode looks kind of like a pinball, doesn't it?  Well, someone thought so.  Metroid Prime Pinball is pretty much what you would expect, conceptually, a pinball game with Metroid (Prime) trappings.  Luckily, the development studio behind it learned a lesson from the much-antagonized [Sonic Spinball](game:Sonic the Hedgehog: Spinball), and so MPP doesn't pretend to be something it's not; though it has "battle mode" minigames, bomb and missile powerups, and even a health meter, it is still a pinball game.

One might think this limits the game in terms of fun factor, but the Metroid formula enhancements actually work quite well.  This is no high adventure epic in a sci-fi wilderness, but it is a rollicking game of pinball.

Unlocking more tables is actually pretty difficult, as you have to complete a series of tasks (moving from one table to another) within three balls; there is no incremental progress.  Nevertheless I look forward to the challenge of it.
