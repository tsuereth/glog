Frankly I just got fed up. My dissatisfaction with Evermore is hard to quantify, but there are a number of contributing reasons which aren't: a lack of vital in-game documentation (e.g. how to throw spears), a very sharp learning curve (when is alchemy needed and when is it wasteful?), and overblown environmental interaction (last I played I got up to a marketplace with a hopelessly complicated merchant-trading system that today's economists would have a difficult time trying to decipher). I think the kicker is that the basic combat gameplay is not fun enough to reward the incoherence of the rest of the game.
