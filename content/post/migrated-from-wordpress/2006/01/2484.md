It's become somewhat of a norm with Sega's developers (especially Sonic Team), since the formal death of the Dreamcast, to remake their DC games for Gamecube - <game:Sonic Adventure 2: Battle>, <game:Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II>, and <game:Skies of Arcadia Legends> are prime examples. It took them a while, but Sonic Team eventually decided to port over one of their most lauded productions: the original [Sonic Adventure](game:Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut).

It could be said, though, that of all their Gamecube remakes, Sonic Adventure DX is the least remade; that is, it is almost indistinguishable from its Dreamcast iteration. This is both good and bad, as while the original SA is highly respected (and for good reason), it's more than a bit behind the times. A great number of improvements could have been made to the control system or to the graphics (especially the atrocious lip-sync), but for the most part they were not. To make a long story short, SADX is SA with more replay value, through an actual motivation to get emblems (unlockable Sonic Team Game Gear games and a special secret for all 130 emblems) and an updated chao system.

Graphically, SADX sports only slightly revamped character models (the main improvement being lighting effects - also, Sonic's mouth doesn't seem quite as large as it used to be). Aside from that and the emblem and chao improvements, the game is unchanged.
