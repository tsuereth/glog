Slightly off-beat for a Kirby game, given that the series relies on a fairly traditional set of controls and gameplay mechanics, and Canvas Curse uses mostly new ideas for getting around. I guess you could say it's like a spinoff game. But, I still found it fun to play through, and if you've got nothing else to do, tooling around to earn medals (for unlocking things) is good for quick spots of time-killing.
