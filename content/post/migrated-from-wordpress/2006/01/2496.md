I beat the first level. This is currently the extent of my progress, and not for lack of trying. Don't get me wrong, I like that it's a Sonic game from yesteryear, a grand return of the old-school mechanics; but it's reminded me that I'm really very bad at old Sonic games. It carries the unfortunate 'classic' flaw of not saving incremental progress and forcing repetition (I can beat Act 1 of Sonic and Blaze's next levels without fail, but various parts in Act 2 screw me up and so when all my lives are gone I'm back to the drawing board), but I will not downplay the role that my lack of skill also plays. For now Sonic Rush has beaten me.
