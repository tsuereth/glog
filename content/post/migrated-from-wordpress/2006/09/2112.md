Basically, you are a ghost, and have the ghostly power to possess things: inanimate objects (like fire extinguishers and computers), small animals (rats and dogs), or people, some of whom have guns. Highlights:

-Controls are pretty good, sometimes aiming is slow but otherwise it's easy to do what you want to do  
-The game is good-looking with all the graphical trappings you would expect from a shooter game  
-Sound effects and music are good but not memorable  
-The single-player story campaign is interesting, challenging, and pretty fun  
-There are puzzles, some in the form of possession chains (which are cool), and some in the form of shining light on mirrors (which aren't as cool)  
-The multiplayer modes are almost all terrible; standard deathmatches are ok, but nothing really special  
-There is basically no replay value  
-Part of the game allows you to play a Simon-like minigame of driving rivets into iron beams  
-The final boss fight is like flying a space shuttle through a tornado while blindfolded
