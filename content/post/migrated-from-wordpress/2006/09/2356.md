The game portion, e.g. running and gunning (though not simultaneously), is really excellently done. Upgrading abilities through collecting blood, enemy weak spots, a wide variety of enemy types and attacks, and different character specialties suited for different situations all make up a great gameplay premise. With a few special ability exceptions, the killing flows ultra-smooth. The storyline was pretty interesting, too. Unfortunately, by halfway through the second-to-last chapter of the game, it basically becomes a long cinema sequence where you hold the 'A' button between cutscenes. Not to mention the confusing nature of the ending, it is really just long and kind of dull. Nonetheless I really enjoyed the rest of it. A short ride, but very fun while it lasted, with the exception of the ending sequence. To boot, the highly stylized graphics and eccentric soundtrack are very pleasing to the senses.
