Being released around the same time as {{% game "Geist" %}}Geist{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy" %}}Psi-Ops{{% /game %}} didn't really work to Second Sight's benefit. As of this time I've barely made my way into this one. It definitely has some interesting trappings of its own, but the mixture of control schemes for shooting and psychic powers thus far fails to impress me.
