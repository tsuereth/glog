Think a combination of the original {{% game "Mario vs. Donkey Kong" %}}MvDK{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Lemmings" %}}Lemmings{{% /game %}}.  You don't have a real Mario this time, but have to lead the Mini Marios through trap-laden stages to an exit.  It's entirely stylus-controlled: shove them in directions, push them down pipes, make them jump on springs, et cetera.  There are tons of mechanisms to exploit (elevators = awesome), and new ones are frequently added to the mix.

The first two worlds were pretty easy, so the challenge thus far has been in getting the Gold Star score, but if it's anything like its predecessor later levels will be impossibly difficult.
