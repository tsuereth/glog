It's not quite a Mega Man title, as it's full of the Battle Network mythos and even has weird Battle Chip mechanics. It's not quite a Battle Network title, because it's really a sidescrolling platformer in the vein of classic Mega Man. What Network Transmission ends up being is confused and unentertaining.
