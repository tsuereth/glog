I'm still not especially confident in Second Sight's controls; now that I'm past the learn-what-you're-doing chapters of the game, the protagonist, John Vattic, must use his gunslinging prowess and psychic powers interchangeably.  Of the game's three perspective modes - cinematic third-person, over the shoulder third-person, and first-person - the third-person views make it difficult to select targets, and the first-person view makes it impossible to aim, period.

It seems rather unintuitive that psychic powers and guns can't be used simultaneously (the same trigger button is used to activate either).  In general, the control scheme seems like it was sloppily pasted onto the game engine.

What Second Sight does have going for it is a really engaging storyline.  The plot is intriguing, having something to do with a special operation overseas gone wrong; and it's told very well, in a combation of cutscenes, in-game voice overs, and psychic flashbacks.

There are also two space-shooter minigames hidden in Second Sight, that you can play by finding a computer disk and an arcade machine in the game.  Cool extras are a plus.
