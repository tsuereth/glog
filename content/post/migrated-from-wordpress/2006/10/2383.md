A tactical game with an action twist and an English accent. Future Tactics is set in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world of... you know, the setting isn't really that interesting. There are evil alien monsters and you have to blow them up. It's turn-based, but units move in real-time when their turn is up, and you can even jump over stuff. However, all attacks (as far as I know) are projectiles, usually guns, but sometimes lobbing grenades. When you attack, you must do a short series of steps to lock on to a target, the accuracy of which will affect your hit.

The cool part about this game (okay, the main cool part - the soundtrack is also pretty spiffy, if a bit loud in some places) is the malleable terrain. When you shoot objects, they can fly up in the air, fall down, roll around; explosions will actually make craters in the ground. This may not have been thought all the way through - after a few hits in the same place, you'll basically have a tiger trap in front of you - but it's a nice thought. Unfortunately the lack of variety in gameplay hasn't compelled me to follow through with this one thus far.
