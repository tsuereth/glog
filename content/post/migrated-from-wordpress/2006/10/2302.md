Second Sight finishes strong, with a cool plot twist and a very satisfying conclusion, after a very respectable length of game.  The story remains this game's greatest victory by a fair margin - while I did <i>come to terms</i> with the shooting and psi controls, I'm still not especially fond of them.  Nonetheless, it was a fairly fun play.
