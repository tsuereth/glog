Imagine you're playing [Super Mario 64](game:Super Mario 64 DS), but instead of Mario, you're controlling a weird little wolfman-child-thing. Also, instead of collecting Stars and Coins, you're collecting <i>Wraithhearts</i> and <i>Wraithheart Shards</i>. Also, instead of saving the princess from the evil king Bowser, you're saving the universe(?) from the evil king I don't care what his name is.

Now, imagine that there are metal claw-gloves on your hands that are, individually, bigger than your head. This isn't just the main character's gimmick, this is what playing the game <i>feels like</i>. Trying to maneuver, climb walls, and even fight shit is an exercise in tolerance.

Without having played too much of the game - I think I have like six out of 60 of the whatevers I need to beat it - I'm going to pre-emptively give this game a rating of 1/10. That one point is for having the chutzpah to actually be released in a world which clearly does not welcome this game.

<i>Progress: 6 Wraithhearts</i>
