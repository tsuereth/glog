Enjoyable at times, but overwhelmingly mediocre. The driving and rail-shooting levels had the capacity to be very exciting, but they were overshadowed by the more-prevalent standard Bond missions, which themselves were populated by objectives ranging from confusing to dull. Getting lost in a level is never a fun thing to do.

If you liked Agent Under Fire, Nightfire is up the same alley, but otherwise it's worth little more than a casual play, if that.
