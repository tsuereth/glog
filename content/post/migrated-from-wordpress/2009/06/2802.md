The difficulty keeps ramping up.  I've lost a few times, now.  The final ten levels are back in the sun, but on your <i>roof</i>, and you need to place special planters to amass your plant army.  Meanwhile the curvature of the roof also demands that you use new, catapult-style lobbing plants, and new foes include zombies with pogo sticks, and <i>bungee zombies</i> that fly down from the sky and fuck up your shit.

At the same time, new mini-games and "puzzles" (which aren't very puzzling, but are still fun) are slowly unlocking.  I try them out of necessity, as I need more money to buy upgrade items - or so I think, as most of them turn out to be useless - but each one has a fun charm all its own.  One puzzle scenario has me playing as the zombies, and trying to get to the brains on the other side.  Awesome.

I'd be surprised if the final few levels frustrate me <i>too</i> much, which is cool.  I almost finished this last one, but I made some bad design decisions that ended up kicking my ass later on.  While there's definitely an element of luck in Plants vs. Zombies, in where zombies come from and what types show up when, in general it isn't enough to overpower the game's real strategy- and sometimes reaction-based challenge.
