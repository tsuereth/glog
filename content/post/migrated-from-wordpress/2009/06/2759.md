Yes, this game <i>is</i> fun again.  Despite having to swim for 20 minutes to build up my stats to take a story mission; despite <i>another</i> mission that had me driving all the way across the map - <i>back to Los Santos</i> - and fail when I drove too slowly (and then again when I drove too quickly); despite dying at the tail end of a mission when I <b>exploded</b>, inexplicably - apparently I didn't see someone throwing a grenade in my shoes.

The incredibly ambitious scope of San Andreas amplifies the engine's shortcomings and the still-maturing mission design staff's flaws.  But there's still plenty of fun in here.  I finally got out of San Fierro, and I just did a mission where I drove a monster truck around the desert.  This beast is probably the pinnacle of the GTA3 engine: an off-road vehicle that can <i>actually be steered</i>.  I love this thing.
