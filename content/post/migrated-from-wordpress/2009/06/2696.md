I hadn't even heard of this thing until I saw a mini-review of it nestled in the back of a month-old Nintendo Power I was catching up on.  The review indicated that the makers of Black Sigil had perhaps been <i>inspired</i> by {{% game "Chrono Trigger" %}}Chrono Trigger{{% /game %}}.  The 5.0/10 review wasn't exactly favorable, but uttering the words 'Chrono' and 'Trigger' in the same sentence isn't something I take lightly.  Go on, <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/black-sigil-blade-of-the/2822">take a look</a>.

Is there a word between "uncanny" and "stolen?"  I've been trying to think of one, but haven't so far.

I seriously suspect that this game began life as a ROM hack for Chrono Trigger, and that the final product may or may not use a Super NES emulator as part of its "engine."  Really, this is hilarious.  I mean even the level/terrain designs look like they've been lifted directly from CT and/or other 16-bit Square RPGs.

That said, if you're going to carbon-copy a game, Chrono Trigger is an ideal candidate.  And coming out of the gate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00104KJ2E">dirt</a> <a href="http://www.buy.com/prod/black-sigil-blade-of-the-exiled/q/loc/108/206526541.html">cheap</a> doesn't hurt, either.  Apparently this just came out like yesterday, so I'll hold off for a bit just to confirm that the game is actually playable.  Hopefully they aren't cease-and-desisted first!  Bahahahaha.
