It's definitely got the same old Mario and Luigi action-platform-RPG mechanics going.  Other than that, I can't really say that I'm looking forward to this yet; the overall pacing of {{% game "Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time" %}}Partners in Time{{% /game %}} was what wore on me, in part <i>because</i> the battle system was the same old story, and the doors look wide open for this game to do the same thing.  Or, it could be a huge improvement and totally awesome again.  We'll see.
