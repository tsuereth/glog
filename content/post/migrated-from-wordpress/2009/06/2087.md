Most of the demo's text was <i>missing</i> (and the rest was in <i>Spanish??</i>), so I have no clue what the game is "about" or how more advanced stuff might control.  But I still had no problem figuring out how to run, jump, attack, and rotate the camera.  At least as far as I played, it's just like the PS2 Kingdom Hearts games, albeit with more shameful graphics.  This one could be a winner.
