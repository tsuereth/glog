Supposedly a handheld take on the GTA formula, Cop: The Recruit certainly has the bullet points: driving, shooting, a free-roaming city, and I guess the plot is about crooked cops or something.  But I kept shooting at pedestrians' heads, and all they did is run away.  Then I stole a bus and started running over things.  At no point did anyone <i>react</i> at all.

Not a clue what the game's mission objectives are, but if they want it to feel like GTA, Ubisoft's got a lot of designing to do.  Without a world that reacts to your hijinks, a sandbox game is really more of a dry pavement game.
