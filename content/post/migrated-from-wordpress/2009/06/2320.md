When a game controls this well, it doesn't really have to do a lot else to differentiate itself from the crowd.  High Voltage's biggest bullet point is "It's a Wii Shooter," and on that, they certainly deliver.

What surprised me about the demo though is how <i>bad</i> it looked.  Not all around, but inconsistently.  The game perhaps overuses full-screen blur effects, when you're injured, when there are explosions, when you zoom your scope in and out.  But when the game <i>isn't</i> blurry, it actually looks really bad.  Enemies are jagged monstrosities, blending in with the jagged morass of the surrounding environment.

I don't think the final game is actually supposed to look like this, though.  It's coming out this month, so it must be gold by now - but I guess it's possible that the demo was from an old build.
