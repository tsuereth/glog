Man, this game is fun again.  Now that I'm back to the occasional, comparatively middling frustrations of slippery controls and dying easily, it feels like the good old days.  And now that I've got new mission spots opening up, San Fierro is a fun city to play around in - I'm saving a nerd (David Cross) from a chess opponent, escorting a blind Triad boss through his own lackeys, and trying to get in good with a pimp (Charlie Murphy) to uncover a mysterious gang conspiracy.  Times like these make CJ's (my) amorality and reckless driving a real thrill again.
