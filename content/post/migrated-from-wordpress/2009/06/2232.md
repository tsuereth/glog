I shied away from the original {{% game "Red Steel" %}}Red Steel{{% /game %}} largely due to reports that the swordplay controlled like ass.  So controls were my top concern when I tried Red Steel 2, and - granted I haven't tried anything near the game's full repertoire of items and events - I'm really, really pleased with them.  Gun controls are a tough thing to screw up on the Wii, but the sword movement, thanks to the MotionPlus (and presumably some heavy software polish), is downright <i>intuitive</i>.  It took me all of 15 seconds to jump into the middle of the demo and go to work.

Something I didn't expect was how nice the game looks, like {{% game "XIII" %}}XIII{{% /game %}}'s comic book shading but without the comic book part.  The game is just stylized enough to look gorgeous without  itself with visual detail.
