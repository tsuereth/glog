Style, Wet has.  But the gameplay never evolves beyond what you see in the demo; it just gets more frustrating.  The bullet-time mechanic wears out its welcome pretty quickly, extra weapons never have enough ammo to keep things interesting, and new abilities are scant.  Not to mention, when it comes time to spend upgrade points, you'll always have to make a choice between <i>getting</i> those new abilities, or keeping up with the difficulty curve instead, by getting more health and higher damage.

It's not exactly long, but Wet is <b>too</b> long, for what it is.  The last several levels just drag on.  And maybe the terrible final boss and ending is a surprise complement to the grindhouse theme, but it comes across as a sloppy, rushed conclusion.

Play the demo - it's fun, and it shows that the concept has legs.  Unfortunately the full game never goes anywhere interesting with it.

I gotta give props to the music, though, which fits the theme of the game perfectly.
