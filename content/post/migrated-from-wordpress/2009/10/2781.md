So there are two ways to play Borderlands, solo and co-op.  Thus far I've only been in the wastelands with friends, and it is a total blast.  This is the new {{% game "Diablo II" %}}Diablo II{{% /game %}} - with <i>shooting</i> instead of spellcasting.  Color-coded loot spills out of boss monsters as their bloody gibs explode into the air.  Vicious dog-monsters spit projectile acid.  Extra-tough monsters earn the nominal prefix "Badass."  <b>There are midgets with shotguns</b>.

I'd love to play the game by myself, too, so I can actually see the exposition and understand what the fuck is wrong with this place.  Regardless, co-op is a ton of fun.
