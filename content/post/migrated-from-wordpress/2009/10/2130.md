I <i>still</i> hadn't taken advantage of the free Tales of Monkey Island episode I downloaded on Talk Like a Pirate Day, so I sat down with it today, and figured it would be a fun way to spend an hour or two.  It turned out to eat up my whole evening.  For the most part, I was really pleased with it; more so than the other free Telltale episodes I've tried so far (Sam &amp; Max, Wallace and Gromit).

The last few puzzles really pissed me off, serving as extreme reminders of what can go wrong in a point-and-click adventure game: namely, obtuse and arbitrary puzzle solutions, and forced sequences (e.g. point C was accessible, but unsolvable, until I'd solved points A and B).  Until that point, though, Screaming Narwhal had more reminded me of what can go <i>right</i> in an adventure game: mind-testing logic puzzles, narrative mysteries, and strong writing.

I'm still not planning on getting the rest of the series - at least, not at this point.  First I'll have to see if I get <s>emotionally</s> intellectually invested in the characters from the catching up I'll be doing with their {{% game "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition" %}}previous adventures{{% /game %}}.
