Raising Hell extends <game:Overlord>'s hilarious campaign, but at least so far, it doesn't really add to the experience.  The original game stretched its tenuous gameplay far enough already; this expansion brings new levels that riff on the old ones, and a few new abilities, but it doesn't feel <i>different</i> at all.  Which is good, for the sake of seeing more witty parodies of fantasy tropes.  But by the last level of Overlord I was ready for it to be over.

At least it should be short.
