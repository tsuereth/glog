When I woke up this morning, my first thought was <i>shit, I've overslept</i>.  Second was <i>I want to finish Braid</i>.  So I did.  Worth it.

The story threw me for a loop at the end, until I checked <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/955510/53842">the interweb</a> for some instant gratification.  Very interesting stuff, but it's not really why I like the game.  The gameplay is just so mind-bendingly awesome.

Really, the only complaint I can lodge against it is that there are so few enemy types.  One or two more, I think, would have been cool.  But it's inconsequential to the jumping, time-fucking crux of the game.

Braid has left me wanting <i>more</i>.  Maybe not enough to restart the game so I can collect everything - maybe so.  I'll have to see if I'm still hungry for time-warping after some {{% game "Borderlands" %}}Borderlands{{% /game %}}.
