The Heaven's Peak Abyss - in which William the Paladin, who succumbed to Lust in the original game, was made to do housework for a gaggle of conniving housewives - was a return to confusing and disjointed level design.  But it was brief, at least, and pretty funny.

In the Golden Abyss, the dwarf king Goldo - who in the original game was overcome with Greed - had turned into a golden statue.  The gameplay device was to collect gold sacks from around the level, to lure dwarves to Goldo, who was then slowly mined and picked down to nothing.  As with the Evernight Abyss theater stage, I thought this level worked well because of its centerpiece area; though some of the adjacent paths got a little confusing, the level was generally straightforward.

With one Abyss left to go, I'm no longer disappointed in my Raising Hell purchase, although I still feel that it doesn't offer much more than the core Overlord game; just more <i>of</i> it.
