Being a prequel, the ending of Extraction pretty much ruined itself.  And the way it answers each question about the Dead Space story with two <i>more</i> questions is a bit perturbing.  Outside of that, I'm really impressed with this package.  It's got a compelling and exciting campaign (at least, it was compelling with two players), as well as a story-less Challenge Mode where you can just blow necromorphs to bits for fun.

It <i>also</i> has, in the form of bonus features, a "moving comics" presentation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_(comics)">Dead Space comic books</a>.  Me and my comrade-in-space-arms watched these after the campaign expecting some trite fanservice shit, but they're actually quite good, largely due to some excellent voice acting and thrill-a-minute pacing.  Apparently you can also watch them on <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/game/dead-space/5563">GameTrailers</a> if you're so inclined.  There are a lot of worse ways to spend an hour or so.
