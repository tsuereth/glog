Legendary did <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/legendary">not</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/legendary">fare</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/legendary">well</a> in reviewing circles, and it's not hard to see why.  The weapons are depressingly common; the conspiracy-theory plot is really no different from most first-person shooters out today; and the game's "legendary" monsters are, effectively, beefed-up enemy NPCs that don't actually change up the FPS formula.  In other words, it does virtually nothing to distinguish itself.

At the same time though - at least as far as I saw in the demo - the core FPS elements that it therefore relies on, are actually implemented fairly well.  You expect shooters to get a little awkward when you're fighting, say, a <i>minotaur</i> that takes several dozen shotgun shells to down, but a combination of (somewhat) effective environmental cover and an easy healing system make it feel like it <i>should</i> feel: a difficult boss encounter.

I don't have high hopes, but I'll gladly give the full game a whirl - for a few bucks - when I've got the time.  On a PC, anyway; the controls definitely felt like they'd work better with a mouse.
