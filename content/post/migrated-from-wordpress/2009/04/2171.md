Like {{% game "Zone of the Enders" %}}Zone of the Enders{{% /game %}}, this is a game many people would not have bought except for the highly-anticipated game demo that came with it at the time ({{% game "Halo 3" %}}Halo 3{{% /game %}}).  Unlike ZoE, it has also enjoyed a healthy amount of success on its own right, because it is a charming little game.  While games like True Crime had already tried a good-guy take on the Grand Theft Auto sandbox formula, Crackdown takes that perspective and adds a robust RPG-like system of leveling up individual attributes.  More than that - leveling up doesn't just make you powerful, it makes you <i>amazingly superhuman</i>.  This is a sandbox game where you can become a supercop that leaps over buildings, and tosses SUVs at gang members.  I honestly don't know how <i>deep</i> the game gets, but the basic gameplay has me sold already.
