I didn't play this one very much, because it kind of threw me for a loop.  Banjo-Kazooie's traditional elements - from music notes to jiggies - are all here.  But the setting is completely different: Gruntilda is merely an opponent in a challenge set up by the Lord of Games, and the gameplay focus is on difficult-to-categorize vehicle construction and driving elements.  With amazingly poor handling.

I'm tempted to call Nuts & Bolts the "toybox" to Grand Theft Auto's "sandbox," but I really don't know enough about the hard <i>goals</i> of the game to say.  At the same time, the game's eerie combination of familiar platforming and bizarre vehicles are somehow uncompelling; so I may never find out what the point of the game really is.
