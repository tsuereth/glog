Comparisons to GTA fall apart quickly - while Crackdown has the open-world violence thing going, the gameplay really feels different.  For one thing: driving sucks.  Cars handle like hell, and since your bioengineered crime fighter can jump over buildings (and run faster than most cars drive anyway), I haven't even bothered trying to drive since my first couple missions.  Also, the aiming is very different, using an accuracy mechanism that makes it more ... <i>fun</i>, like a minigame.

On the one hand, the game is definitely short.  In two sit-downs (of a few hours each), I've already maxed two of my character's five primary stats, and cleaned the crime-ridden city of two of its three criminal organizations.  On the other hand, these hours have been <i>amazingly</i> fun.  Between leaping across rooftops to find agility upgrades, exploring Pacific City for new criminal hideouts, and just plain tooling around looking for thugs to mop up, there's (almost) never a dull moment.

The game is not without flaws; sometimes the aiming gets caught on things you don't want to aim at, sometimes a target is unreasonably difficult to find and takes some wandering around to get to.  And like I said, it's definitely short.  But man, is it <i>fun</i>.
