I give props to Red Alert 3 for bridging the gap between the quirkiness of {{% game "Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert" %}}Red Alert{{% /game %}} and the sensibilities of the rest of the RTS genre - and for bringing some new and cool gameplay elements to the table, like the co-commander.  But I still feel like there's something wrong with it.  Maybe it's the intense micromanagement necessary to make the most of the game's unique units; maybe it's the feeling of familiarity in general combat situations that are diluted to pure numbers games.  Maybe it's the fact that I don't like strategy games.  Hmm.
