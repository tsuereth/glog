I didn't much care for the Afro Samurai anime, but as I watched it I got the impression that it would make a super-cool video game.  As it turns out, it made a repetitive, uninteresting video game.

The time-slowing focus moves are cool, and satisfyingly bloody.  But grinding through enemies with normal moves - which you have to do to build up enough power to slow time - is incredibly dull and chorelike.  And while the absence of a HUD complements the (beautiful) art style very well, it makes determining when you can or cannot use these powers unnecessarily confusing.  Furthermore, though Sammy J. does his best to spice up the dialog, the plot is bland; and the way it's relayed to the player (proceeding along a linear path to kill dudes) is mechanical and boring.
