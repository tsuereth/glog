It's a real shame that the whole game couldn't be like the demo.  Despite occasional camera frustration and slow-down-to-kill-enemies sequences, it is the best attempt yet - better than the first {{% game "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut" %}}Sonic Adventure{{% /game %}} - at translating Sonic's high-speed action into a 3D game that is also fun.  At least, the daytime sequences are.  It's rather telling that the nighttime, <i>werewolf</i> sequences are omitted from the demo.  Had they been omitted from the retail game, I might be inclined to play it, too.
