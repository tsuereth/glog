In a word: vapid.  Dynasty Warriors represents the ultimate in brainless hack-and-slash gaming: hordes of enemies eagerly swarm around you just so they can fall to your sword.  The fanservicey Gundam take on it seems no different, with the possible exception that Milliardo's whip attack left me with literally no recourse, as I was juggled to death.  I have no idea what I could have done to avoid death, and really, I don't care either.
