{{% game "Tales of Symphonia" %}}Tales of Symphonia{{% /game %}}'s 3D take on the <i>Tales</i> battle system was fun and interesting at the time, but five years on, it is feeling a little stale.  And a stale battle system is about the worst problem an RPG can have, giving way to underleveled characters, and thus frustrating boss encounters.  The incredibly long-winded story conversations don't help, either.  Truthfully, I could not wait for my party to die just so they'd shut up.
