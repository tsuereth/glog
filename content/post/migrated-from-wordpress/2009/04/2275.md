Controls are the <a href="http://kotaku.com/5026780/bionic-commando-has-control-issues">popular</a> <a href="http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/04/15/bionic-commando-preview-die-die-again">concern</a> about the upcoming Bionic Commando reboot, and frankly, they are valid.  A few minutes with the multiplayer demo on Xbox Live has left me anxious - but also wary - toward how they will work out in the final game.  By my second match, I had started to get the hang of the arm's zip-line feature; but being able to use it <i>effectively</i> to scale sheer structures etc. still eluded me.

Here's hoping that the single player game has a good tutorial, or a proper beginning sequence that eases into the control system's finer points.  I admire GRIN's goal of enabling complex player behavior with a complex control set, but it doesn't mean anything if I can't play it.
