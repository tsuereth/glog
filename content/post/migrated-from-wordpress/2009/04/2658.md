Really, <game:Perfect Dark> was little more than an extremely competent shooter, made in an era where such a thing was still ultra-rare on consoles.  So it shouldn't necessarily come as a surprise that the sequel fails to breach the current shooter game standards.  But the fact that it doesn't really distinguish itself is pretty disappointing nevertheless.  Where the original PD pushed the envelope for console shooters, PDZ is content to settle in familiar territory, and no amount of laptop sentry guns can save a game from that.
