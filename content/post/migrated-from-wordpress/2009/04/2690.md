Guerrilla aims to bring the previous Red Faction games' innovative-for-its-time environment deformation, together with the game structure <i>du jour</i>, a third-person shooter with open-world missions.  As such, a large part of the game's strength (or weakness) will lie in the execution of the game world, which I wasn't terribly impressed with in the demo; being set on Mars, the game has a mutated case of "Everything is Brown" where instead, everything is red.  But the destructibility is a big turn-on - smashing a building with a huge hammer is fairly satisfying, and using a construction vehicle to <i>drive through</i> a structure, even more so.  Still on the fence, but I'll be keeping my eye on this one.
