A month later and I've finally come back for another sit-down with FFXII.  There are a lot of things I can say about it - nonsensical plot development, retarded gambit insufficiencies, full party combat feels like an RTS - but in general I still give a solid "meh" to the whole experience.  Taken in parts, I'd say the bad outweighs the good (especially since I've spent <i>most</i> of the game so far in <i>underground tunnels</i>), but the gameplay is low-key enough that I find myself just coasting along with nary a care.

In short sessions, anyway.  I can only get a couple hours in before it starts to feel like a real drag.  I'm sure I'll finish the game sometime in the next year or so.
