There's a secret world, where levels are unlocked by collecting all the star coins in the previous 8 worlds.  There is no way in hell that our four-player team would be able to pull this off; just <i>finishing</i> World 8 practically took all night by itself, to say nothing of the elusive star coins.  But I'm chomping at the bit to try this on my own.
