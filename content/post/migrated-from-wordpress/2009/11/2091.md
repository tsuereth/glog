This game <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-minute-taste-jurassic-the-hunted-154558.phtml">looks fucking hilarious</a>.  So I was immensely pleased to see a demo on Xbox Live!  But immensely disappointed when I found that the demo's only playable component is a 'survival' challenge, where you have to shoot dinosaurs to protect a fort.  No retarded story or hackneyed dialog or <i>anything</i>.

Shame, I guess.  I'd love to drink my way through the campaign once this gets cheap.
