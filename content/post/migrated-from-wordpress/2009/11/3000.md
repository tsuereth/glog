This game is crazy-fun.  I've been playing it with a co-worker and a buddy and his wife, and with four players it is both A) impossible to get anything accomplished and B) a complete blast.  This is like [Four Swords Adventures](game:The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures) in hyperdrive - you'll be getting fucked over (and fucking other people over) by <i>accident</i> so much, that the intentional revenge trips will seem like nothing.

The chaotic shitstorm of multiplayer is great, which is to say nothing of single-player, since I haven't actually tried it yet.  But it's easy to see that with new power-ups (propeller suit!), classic Super Mario level design, ghost houses, <i>Koopa Kids</i>, wall-jumps, <i>triple</i>-jumps, and everything else that's helped make Mario great since 1986 - there's an awesome Mario game in here, too.  I'm looking forward to trying that out.
