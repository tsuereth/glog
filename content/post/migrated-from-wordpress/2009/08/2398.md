When I saw the case-tin that the Prime Trilogy comes in, <b>I had to possess it</b>.  MPT's offering is straightforward - the trilogy of Metroid Prime titles, all redone in the Wii stylings of Prime 3 - and if you've missed any of them, this is one of the easiest purchasing decisions you'll make in your life.  Having already enjoyed the hell out of {{% game "Metroid Prime" %}}all{{% /game %}} {{% game "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes" %}}three{{% /game %}} {{% game "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" %}}games{{% /game %}}, I wasn't sure I'd ever bother opening the case; but now I'm glad to have an excuse for replaying some of the Gamecube's finest.

Actually, myself and some buddies have been playing through the first two games together, taking turns.  Since we've all played them before, this allows us to each get our Metroid Prime fix without plodding through familiar ground for hours on end.  As it turns out, these games are pretty cinematic, too, so watching is fun as well.  (One of them hasn't played Prime 3 yet, which I'm really looking forward to watching again.)
