After my first play session with Prototype, I would have glogged (but didn't - busy week) about how underwhelming the whole experience is: how the story is disposible tripe, how the "web of intrigue" is a jumbled mess of not-intriguing sound bites, how combat feels unengaging and empty, how the city is repetitive and without personality.  My initial impressions were, shall we say, <i>bad</i>.

My second session, however, changed my opinion a little.  All the above complaints still stand - the story is dull, basic fighting sucks, and the city is uninspired.  The missions aren't terribly interesting either.  But! this second session also saw me gliding across entire city blocks, hijacking a tank, and jump-kicking a <i>helicopter</i>.

Prototype is light on compelling gameplay - even the experience-gaining and upgrade system seems barely sufficient - but the game is great at delivering <b>wow</b> moments, and these at least appear to ramp up over time.  Hopefully, it'll get better than just balancing out the game's other lackluster traits.
