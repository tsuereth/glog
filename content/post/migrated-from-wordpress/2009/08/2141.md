<game:Stranglehold> had a cool mechanic going - bullet-time jumps and dives - but there wasn't much else to the game.  Wet feels like a real fleshing-out of this idea, complete with a sword, berserker mode, quick-time events, and a fantastic grindhouse-styled setting.  It isn't especially deep, but it <b>oozes</b> style.

Also, the soundtrack is incredible.
