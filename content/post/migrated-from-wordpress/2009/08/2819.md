Prototype is dull to start, shines brightly in the middle, then fades into needless frustration toward the end.  There is some real fun here, like hijacking helicopters with a biological grappling hook (awesome), but it's seriously clouded by a generally boring overworld, terrible story, and questionable tuning in boss encounters.

I think the heart of the problem is, specifically, that you are a mutated super-man.  Individual enemies pose no threat to you unless they're also hideously overpowered, or come in enormous numbers.  And some design mis-steps in the way of uninterruptible attacks, and an indescribably bad targeting system, keep the playing field from ever really feeling even.  When I wasn't slaughtering enemies without a second thought, I was being pounded by a <i>downpour</i> of bullets and rockets.

If you're really thirsting for open-world mayhem, Prototype has a sizeable <i>amount</i> of that, but having barely scratched the surface of side-missions and the Web of Intrigue I found them completely un-compelling.  I would much rather [hijack cars](game:Grand Theft Auto IV) and drive them off bridges.
