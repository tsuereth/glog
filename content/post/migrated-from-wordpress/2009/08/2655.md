A charming afternoon diversion.  <a href="http://www.zombie-cow.com/?page_id=17">Ben There, Dan That!</a> is more than just a quaint little adventure game in the vein of old Lucasarts point-and-clicks, it's also custom tailored to please and amuse anyone who's played them.  An item in the shape of [Max](game:Sam & Max: Save the World)'s head, constant references to [Monkey Island](game:The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition), even the graphical style seems to emulate the classics.  But rather than seeming a rip-off, BTDT is brimming with clever (yet accessible) puzzling and humorous dialog of its own.

A fun way to kill a few hours, and a real treat for any fan of the old Lucasarts stuff.
