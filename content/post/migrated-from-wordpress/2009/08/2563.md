A title update borked my save file (it kept my level, but my progress was gone!) - so I got to play the first few hours of the game all over again.  The second time through, it was actually <i>more</i> fun.  By virtue of its [easy-to-understand mechanics](game:Super Metroid), Shadow Complex revels in its details, as each new item and new passageway is a joy to find.

Despite not being especially new, Shadow Complex has really grown on me.  Its occasional flaws (aiming, camera, pacing, saving) are no match for some good-old-fashioned game design.
