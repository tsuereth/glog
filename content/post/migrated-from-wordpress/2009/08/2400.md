Darkest of Days is a great concept with a middling execution.  You're a soldier in Custer's army, kidnapped through time by a mysterious (benevolent?) agency trying to protect the timeline from some other mysterious (sinister?) entity.  Cool: you get to shoot people in various time periods.  <i>Cooler</i>: you get to bring <i>other</i> eras' weapons.

That said, mowing down the confederate army with an automatic machine gun wasn't really as satisfying as I thought it would be.  The shooting is competent, at least - but, as with <game:Legendary>, that just doesn't seem like enough.

Darkest of Days does have one of the coolest characters I've seen in a shooter, your Texan handler who curses like a... well, like a Texan.  (His video description of <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/exclusive-firearms-darkest-of/53410">the game's weaponry</a> is probably more fun than the game itself.)  So if you're okay with it being Yet Another Shooter, it does at least have a flavor of its own.  And maybe a plot?  Who knows.  I'll just keep watching that video, instead.
