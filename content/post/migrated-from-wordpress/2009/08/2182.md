Blizzard is <i>finally</i> doing what I've wanted since 2005 - expanding on the loose ends left over in {{% game "World of Warcraft" %}}WoW classic{{% /game %}}'s original zones - and I'm really excited to see stuff like Gilneas, Uldum, Grim Batol, and Goblins at work.  Hopefully, I'll still be excited whenever this actually comes out.
