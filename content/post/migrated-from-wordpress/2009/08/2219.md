Despite its gee-whiz graphics and 3D stylings, Shadow Complex feels very much like a Super NES game.  And so its flaws - the questionable item pacing, the occasional glitches in aiming and movement, a few poor camera choices - are forgivable.  Shadow Complex is a tightly-crafted <game:Super Metroid> clone, and I'm looking forward to how Chair builds on the formula (...assuming they do) in the inevitable follow-up.
