Imagine {{% game "The Lost Vikings" %}}The Lost Vikings{{% /game %}} set in medieval swords-and-sorcery land.  You have a wizard who can float things around, and magically conjure up blocks; a thief who can swing from a grappling hook; and a warrior who blocks falling rocks and beats up skeletons.  Oh, also, <i>there's co-op</i> - you switch between the characters in solo play, or multiple players can use each character simultaneously, making for wicked-fun physics-based hijinks.

As a single-player outing, Trine is interesting and inventive, if frustratingly difficult.  Dying seems too easy, especially with all these spikes everywhere.  Multiplayer is fun not just for the teamwork-oriented challenge, but also because you can screw around and toss your friends into fire.  The physics-based game world is definitely engaging, and I'd love to play around with it some more.

Problem: co-op is local only; there is no online play.  How lame is that?  I'll gladly buy the game at full price if this is added in, but in lieu of that I'm waiting for a price drop.

<i>Progress: Played the PC demo solo (didn't finish) and co-op (AWESOME)</i>
