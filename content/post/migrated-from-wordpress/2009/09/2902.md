Speaking of finding out more about Knights in the Nightmare - <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/to-the-knights-in/34781">this gameplay video</a> shows perhaps <i>too</i> much of the game, or more precisely, how <i>utterly terrifying</i> it apparently becomes.  Look at all the dodging, item collecting, attack making, timing, numbers, explosions, what the fuck?

It appears to demand more expertise in schmup-style reactivity than in RPG number-crunching, which is definitely not how I'd prefer it to lean.  Ehhhhh I've lost interest.
