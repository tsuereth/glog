Alright, let's get one thing straight right off the bat.  <b>There is no multiplayer</b>.  Yes - this is a <i>Golden Axe</i> game without <i>multiplayer</i>.  One could argue that this makes it <b>not a Golden Axe game</b>.  (I would, for instance.)

If you can find it in you to look past this flaw, don't worry; there are plenty more.  The camera is, while not the worst in game history, pretty shoddy by 2008 standards.  The block/parry mechanics - core to the basic combat - are awkward and unwieldy.  The titular beasts, which you ride, are also clumsy.  There is a vapid, totally unnecessary story.  Some extremely poorly designed sequences require slow and dull backtracking.  The music is completely uninspired.  And the basic hacking and slashing is, well, boring.

On the plus side:  
- The graphics are pretty good  
- The dwarf from {{% game "Golden Axe" %}}the original{{% /game %}} is an NPC  
- The gnomes (thieves) have a remixed theme

It's kind of terrible.  I paid $15 for this, and feel like that's just on the cusp of an acceptable asking price.  Beast Rider is <i>playable</i>, but as for <i>why</i> one would want to play this, I really don't know.

Well - hopefully there are some tits later on.
