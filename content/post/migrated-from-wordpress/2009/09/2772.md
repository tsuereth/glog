My interest in Tunnel Rats was seeing how terrible it would inevitably be, not necessarily experiencing it for myself.  Luckily <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/tunnelrats/review.html">GameSpot</a> and <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/986/986117p1.html">IGN</a> describe the horrors of Tunnel Rats in sufficiently excruciating detail.

Reading about tunnel snakes "...who have, for all practical purposes, forged an unholy alliance with the Viet Cong" really made my day.
