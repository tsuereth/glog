I've tried to play the original {{% game "Metroid" %}}Metroid{{% /game %}} on several occasions, quickly giving up each time.  Coming at the game from decades in its future, trying to manage passwords and no in-game map - it's simply too archaic.  Enter <i>Zero Mission</i>, a remake of the first Metroid based on the {{% game "Metroid Fusion" %}}Metroid Fusion{{% /game %}} engine.  Problem solved!

Zero Mission still has hints of its old-school game design, in some particularly punishing rooms, and in a flat-to-nonexistent narrative (the remake tries to spice things up with some brief animated scenes, but really, they didn't have much to work with).  Nevertheless, the game plays like something out of the 21st century, and I'm grateful for it.

It's a solid game, although I don't really know how much of it is from the original and how much is new.  But however it's been changed, I'm glad to finally experience more than a few minutes of the seminal Metroid.
