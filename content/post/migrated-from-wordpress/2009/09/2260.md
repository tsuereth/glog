Tales of Hearts came out in Japan almost a year ago, and the most recent hint of a North American release is from <a href="http://www.siliconera.com/2008/07/21/we-might-see-tales-of-hearts-in-north-america/">months before that</a>.  There's been <i>word zero</i> about this since last year, which is kind of a bad sign.  Shame, since I definitely liked how the game system set-up looks.
