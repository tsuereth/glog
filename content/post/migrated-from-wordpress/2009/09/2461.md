I was never big on Contra - it's [too hard for me](game:Contra III: The Alien Wars).  In the company of friends, though, the quest to get to the next checkpoint without a Game Over can be quite fun.

That's where the genius bit of ReBirth comes in: it can be finished in an afternoon, with plenty of time to spare.

The game charms with its 16-bit visuals and music (with minimal use of modern graphical sophistication), and there's a campy, ridiculous story to boot.  For a $10 bite-sized portion of Contra, this is pretty perfect.  Just don't expect anything more.
