Yeah, so it's pretty much <game:Pikmin>, but <b>evil</b>.  I'd appreciate a map, a more useful fast-travel system, and less ADD-prone minions - but I'm already in love with this game.  The gameplay is pretty solid, and the theme is just fantastic.

I am actually checking a guide to make sure I don't miss <i>opportunities to be evil</i>.  How awesome is that?  Man.
