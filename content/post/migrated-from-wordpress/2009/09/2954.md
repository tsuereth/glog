Black Sigil's reviews have been, in a word, <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/blacksigil">bad</a>.  To the point where it sounds like traipsing through the game, even with no expectation of fun - just to witness the sheer rip-off-itude at work - sounds like it could be painful.  Consider that Metacritic's sole user review includes the compliment <i>"Mine <b>havent froze yet</b> and im up <b>6-7 hours</b> of gameplay."</i>  (emphasis mine)
