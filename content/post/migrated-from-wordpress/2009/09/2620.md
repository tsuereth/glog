Glitches and camera problems are occasional enough to be frustrating, albeit not enough to make the game unplayable.  So, it's <i>playable</i>, at least.

Other than that:  
- Tyris has a <b>great</b> ass  
- "Blood and shit!" takes the cake for best ending line ever

Not really worth the time or effort, but Beast Rider is, ultimately, mostly harmless and inoffensive.
