This is a pretty easy one.  Only two things to say about RE: Darkside Chronicles-

<b>1)</b> It's incrementally better than {{% game "Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles" %}}Umbrella Chronicles{{% /game %}}, but {{% game "Dead Space: Extraction" %}}Dead Space: Extraction{{% /game %}} still puts it in its place.

<b>2)</b> If the real {{% game "Resident Evil Code: Veronica" %}}Resident Evil Code: Veronica{{% /game %}} is anything like the chapters of Darkside Chronicles about it, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, that game must be fucking terrible.

<i>Progress: Almost (hopefully) finished with Code Veronica</i>
