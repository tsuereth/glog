This is a pretty easy one.  Only two things to say about RE: Darkside Chronicles-

<b>1)</b> It's incrementally better than [Umbrella Chronicles](game:Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles), but <game:Dead Space: Extraction> still puts it in its place.

<b>2)</b> If the real <game:Resident Evil Code: Veronica> is anything like the chapters of Darkside Chronicles about it, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, that game must be fucking terrible.

<i>Progress: Almost (hopefully) finished with Code Veronica</i>
