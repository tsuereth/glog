The tutorial was more interesting than I expected - performing impressive and fun moves is actually pretty easy.  And between the punching and kicking and guns and bullet-time and shit, there is certainly a lot of (easily accessible) variety in what you can do.

But then I got to the part of the demo that actually represents the game.  Monsters everywhere!  I can't see <i>shit</i>.  Difficult to dodge when I can't see what's attacking me.  And apparently there was a giant monster in the background, too!

For me, it turned into a nonsensical button masher, followed by my death.  A fan of the Devil May Cry series may see some sort of strategy and technique in this; I wouldn't know.  All I saw was visual noise and bare thighs.
