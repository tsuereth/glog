Oh yeah, I played the Steam demo of this, too.  Utter garbage.

The engine is very pretty - the models move great, and blood sprays beautifully.  But the game that lies underneath is totally insubstantial.  Mash the attack buttons (one light, one heavy).  Want to defend yourself?  Good luck trying!  Just keep mashing the attack buttons.  Oh what's that, a weapon?  Just keep mashing the attack buttons.  Ah, you've learned a new combo!  Just keep mashing the attack buttons.

Somehow this game managed to feel dry and boring by my <i>second</i> enemy, about eight seconds in.  I figured in the next several scenes it would have to pick up, but, I figured wrong.  What a dull (and annoying, what with the retarded character dialog) piece of trash.
