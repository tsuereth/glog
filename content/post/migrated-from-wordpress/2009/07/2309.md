The hardest part of MadWorld is realizing that, despite all appearances, the game isn't really about killing; it's about <i>maiming</i>.  Not only does trying to swiftly finish enemies get monotonous, but since you don't earn many points for un-creative kills (and you need to reach point goals to progress), it takes <i>longer</i>, exacerbating the problem.  There are plenty of varied and amusing hazards and weapons strewn about the levels, but if you try to "shortcut" the game, getting to the point goals takes <i>longer</i> and is less fun.

Rather than trying to rush to the cool boss battles, then, MadWorld asks you to live in the moment of the level, and to find things to enjoy in the violent playground around you.  I think that the game could be (and, if there's a sequel, <i>should</i> be) more direct in showing you where the ultraviolent delights are - there is a map in the pause screen, and there is a heads-up radar, but again, I run into the issue of visual contrast.  If something in a level isn't already tinged with red blood (which many are, but most aren't), it's just difficult to pick out of the surroundings, especially with monochrome enemies mobbing me at the same time.

Did I mention the boss fights are cool?  In the past few levels I've fought a frankenstein, a buxom vampiress, and a dude on a motorcycle (I fought him <i>with</i> a motorcycle!).  The crazy bosses really remind me of {{% game "No More Heroes" %}}No More Heroes{{% /game %}}, which is, well, <i>awesome</i>.
