As with <game:Assassin's Creed>, my progress in HL2 was wiped by a hard drive failure.  <i>Un</i>like AC, I don't plan on going back and playing HL2 again.

Look, Gordon Freeman.  We had a good run.  But we're just not right for each other.  Past the scientist technobabble and the robust physics engine, you're just about navigating through a dystopian future and shooting dudes, and that really isn't doing it for me.

Maybe, one day, when I'm super-bored, I'll try HL2 again.  Maybe.  Not planning on it.
