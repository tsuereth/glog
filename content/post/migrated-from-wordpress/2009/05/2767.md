I <b>really</b> like the puzzles in this game.  They start out as simply chaining gears together, and within a few levels, I'd already put together gear assemblies on one face of a cube, and steam pipeworks on another side, in order to power a wheeled contraption.  The design is ultra-cool.

But it's a <i>slide puzzle</i>.  God damn it.  Fuck slide puzzles.
