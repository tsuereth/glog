I later went back (with the same partner) and tackled the game again in New Game+.  Like [RE4](game:Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition) before it, RE5 is chock full of replay: this, a Hard mode, Mercenaries, and in a cool twist, a scene/chapter select.  Easy way to relive fun parts of the game, and a fun way to earn easy money for weapon upgrades.  Oh, and a slew of unlockable weapons, of course.

A friend and I were discussing this the other day - other than the graphical fidelity (and maybe the online co-op?), there's really nothing in RE5 that can't be done on the Wii.  If it was re-done in the [RE4 Wii](game:Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition) engine, like [Chop Till You Drop](game:Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop), it could be a near-perfect facsimile.  But with point-to-shoot!  Wouldn't that be cool.

<i>Progress: Finished normal in co-op</i>
