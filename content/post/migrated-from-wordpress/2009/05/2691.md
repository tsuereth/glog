As the story proceeds out of the Los Santos area, the gang war system goes into hiding, giving way to more traditional run-around GTA missions.  Problem is that this game world is <i>huge</i>, and missions have a depressing tendency to order you across the map and back again on a whim.  If San Andreas were any other GTA, this would simply be annoying - but in SA, a lot of the ground you have to cover isn't cityscape, but <i>fields</i> and <i>farmland</i>.  It's <b>boring</b>.

So this is why I've been making extremely slow progress in San Andreas.  To a degree, I think this game may be too big for its own good.  But given that I still haven't visited the game's Vegas-spoof city, I do intend to soldier on.
