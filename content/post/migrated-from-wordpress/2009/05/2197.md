I made a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41508">motorcycle</a>.  And it only cost like 15,000 gold!  Man, I am getting tired of this game again.

The new patch introduced another high-end raid, Ulduar, which has <i>robots</i> (!!) so I hope to visit it at some point.  Other than that, the well has definitely run dry.  Another new addition is an Argent arena where you can earn items and shit based on tokens, that you get from daily quests, so it literally will take X days to get Y reward.  This is clearly <i>Lich King</i>'s ultimate timesink, like the <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Netherwing_dragonflight">Nether drakes</a> in {{% game "World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade" %}}Burning Crusade{{% /game %}}, and I really don't want anything to do with it.

<i>Progress: Level 80</i>
