<i>Overkill</i> has more than a bit of charm in its grindhouse aesthetic and <a href="http://gamers.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/160309_HOTD.aspx">notorious profanity</a>.  Where other light-gun shooters are simply too stupid to take seriously, this one actually makes its ludicrous premise <b>fun</b> and entertaining.  On the other hand, it is still just a light-gun shooter; don't let the home console setting fool you: it's just as long (which is to say, short) as an arcade <i>House of the Dead</i>.  Other than the - fairly limited - weapon upgrading options, there really isn't much here at all.  Fun in a party setting, but still doesn't seem worth the investment.
