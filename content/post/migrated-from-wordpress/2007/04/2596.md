Lunar Knights has grown on me, what with its diversity of weapons, and occasionally challenging combat scenarios; to be sure, slashing up elemental dogs and firing sun-grenades at fat pigs can be pretty fun.  But there are still many situations where the engine shows its age and lack of finesse - especially in the final dungeon, which seems to go on <i>forever</i> with largely unremarkable level design.  The new stuff (weather changing, space shooting) is cool at first but the novelty wears into tedium quickly.

A fun game on the whole, and with a ton of replay if you're willing to put the work in for it, but I still think they could have done better.
