Spiffy.  I've still got a long way to go, but the gameplay devices are pretty much as I imagined they would be.  I'm already seeing the difficulty ramp up, too, though it's still not very challenging.

I do have to voice my gripe with the presentation.  It's good.  <i>Too</i> good.  Sometimes I feel like the actual game is overshadowed by dialog scenes.  I had been hoping this would stop when the NPCs were done reading the game's manual to me, but thus far this is not the case.
