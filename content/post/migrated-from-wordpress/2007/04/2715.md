I haven't played Secret of Mana since I was like eight, which doesn't even really count; all I remember is something about a big cannon and pink trees.  So recently I decided it was time to get back to basics and brush up on the 16-bit classic.  Thus far I haven't gotten very far (at least I don't think I have), and I'm currently experiencing some manner of frustration with the controls, but this may have more to do with my aged equipment than with the game itself.  I will say that the music is splendid and surprisingly vibrant for its time.
