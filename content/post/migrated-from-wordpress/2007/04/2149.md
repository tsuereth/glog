I'm glad I dug up MMZ2 and tried again, for the umpteenth time; the hard-as-nails intro still miffs me a bit, and the new Forms business is kind of a letdown, but the rest of the game is just as fun as the [previous](game:Mega Man Zero).  Like before, there is a great amount of replay in the form of level ranks (and aforementioned hard-to-get forms) for the real die-hard fans, but I'm pretty satisfied with the ~5 hour main story.

Now I can start looking for the [third installment](game:Mega Man Zero 3).
