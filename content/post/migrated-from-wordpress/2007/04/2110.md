Craving a real Star Fox fix after the travesty that was <game:Star Fox Adventures>, I was looking forward to Command before it came out.  Then I learned about the weird tactical scenario planning that you do in campaign missions - a bit unusual.  Still, I thought it would be worth looking into for some good space-shooting action.  Then recently I played some wireless multiplayer with some friends, and the touch-controls are just awful.  Who thought it was a good idea to use the same input method for aiming and for maneuvering gestures?  Trying to boost makes me pitch up.  Fantastic.

I still haven't seen much of the single-player, but now that I've sampled the control scheme, I think I'll pass on this one.
