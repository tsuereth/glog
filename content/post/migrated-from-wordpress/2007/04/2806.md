When I quit last fall, I told my guildmates I might look into WoW again in the summer, when I had free time again.  Since that time period is now imminent - and I was bored the other evening - I decided to check into what's happening in the new and expanded Azeroth.  That may have been a mistake, because now the sci-fi undertones of the newly added geography and the augmented engineering craft list have really tickled my fancy.

There is a 10-day free trial deal going on at the moment, which I'll probably plunge into after finals.  After that... I may not be able to resist.  Gunpei help me.
