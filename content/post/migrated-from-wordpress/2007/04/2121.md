Inane questions and near-duplicates (hot or cold?  heat or ... cold?) are starting to get to me.  Honestly I think the channel is limited by its own design, e.g. short question, two (really) short options.  There's not much you can do with that.  The scope should have been broadened, and a dedicated polling staff should have been brought on to keep good questions going - the fact that you can submit your own shows that Nintendo is not doing much work itself on this.

Anyway, a cool concept but ultimately unsatisfying.  If these questions keep up I'm going to stop turning on my Wii every few days to check up on it.
