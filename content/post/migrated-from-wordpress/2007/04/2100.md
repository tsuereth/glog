I've had MMZ2 for quite a long time, but have never gotten farther than the end of the intro stage - this game is damn hard, I would say moreso than {{% game "Mega Man Zero" %}}the original{{% /game %}} which was already a little masochistic.  Tonight I finally buckled down and polished off two of the first four bosses.

In true Capcom style the sequel additions are fairly scant: a grappling hook and some "forms" that I haven't made much sense of yet.  Otherwise thus far it's pretty much the same old story in a new box.
