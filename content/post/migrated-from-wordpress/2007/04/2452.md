The beginning was tough because, like in the first game, Zero starts out with practically nothing.  I managed to beat the first stages this time from returning to the intro area and grinding up the levels on my weapons; the first couple bosses were still tough, but doable.  From there I've been collecting cyber-elves to increase my power and health, and after using a few of those it's been gravy, at least compared to before.

The forms haven't impressed me.  You earn them based on filling certain criteria in the stage you finish, and the forms will enhance or endow attributes depending on those criteria, e.g. using the saber a lot gets you a form with a new saber move.  That's what I got after the first stage I finished, and so far I haven't bothered with anything else.  I've barely <i>earned</i> anything else, either - the form-earning system is pretty majorly flawed, but it's no big deal because most of them are pretty inconsequential.

So, most of the game isn't as impossible as the first stage or two, but it's still challenging enough to be a Mega Man Zero game.  Like I said; more or less, same story, new box.
