As I attempted to meet the herculean crest requirements to unlock the final kingdoms of the game, I found my skill increasing alongside the rising challenge.  The scoring system is deep and involved for those who enjoy competing for a high score - combo multipliers from certain sequential actions, beat bonuses for clap-collecting.  Getting more difficult crests requires becoming accustomed to flowing through levels and collecting beats exponentially, which was fun, but difficult enough that I probably won't bother going back to earn the crests I missed.  Trouncing the final-final-boss is satisfying enough.

At the end of the day Jungle Beat is a unique and fun game wholly deserving of at least a try.

<i>Progress: 54 crests, beat Ghastly King</i>
