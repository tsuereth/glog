No sooner did I mention the glut of dialog that it stopped being a problem.  Things really picked up in Chapter 3 - which is, as of yet, both the most awesome and most hilarious segment in any video game ever.  I just hope the rest of the game can stand up to these kinds of standards.

The chapter organization is a bit disorienting at first; each of the game's (8?) chapters consists of four parts, each part being like a big Mario stage with puzzles and warp pipes and so forth.  There is a hub world from which you can begin each chapter from part 1, and apparently you can revisit completed chapter parts at any time, but it is not your typical, seamlessly connected RPG world.

Really, there is very little about Super Paper Mario that is typical for an RPG.  It is more like a cross between the sidescrolling action of a [Mario Bros.](game:New Super Mario Bros.) game and the level design and puzzling of the previous [Paper](game:Paper Mario) [Mario](game:Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door)s.  Thus far it appears to be working out fairly well.
