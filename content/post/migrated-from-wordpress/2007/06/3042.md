Nearly a week before its North American release, the DS browser showed up in the Nintendo employee store.  The idea of browsing the web from exceedingly small devices has recently excited me, so I threw down my money and made the purchase.  But!  What was behind the counter, and now in my bag, was not the shelved DS browser, but the Lite version, whose memory expansion pack will not fit in my old, obese DS Classic.  The boxes look very similar, so <i>caveat emptor</i>.

Now that the copy I had to order from Nintendo's online store has arrived (in record shipping time), I, too, can enjoy the World Wide Tubes on a screen slightly larger than my thumb.  While the small interface is a little difficult to use - I am typing this entire message on it - it is at least usable.

The small format also introduces rendering issues, but of course this can't really be helped.  What this software should be best for is finding minute nuggets of information while on the go (and near a hotspot).

Surprisingly, this browser is much more feature-rich than {{% game "Internet Channel" %}}its Wii counterpart{{% /game %}}, though it also appears to be slightly less capable in terms of, say Javascript.
