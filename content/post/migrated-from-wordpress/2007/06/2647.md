I played a coworker (NST Hiro) today.  He completely obliterated me.  I want to practice enough to compete with him, but at the same time I don't know if that's possible - his puzzling feats seemed purely <i>magical</i>.

He recommended the Active Puzzle mode for good training, which I suppose I'll move on to once I finish the Advanced (static) puzzles.
