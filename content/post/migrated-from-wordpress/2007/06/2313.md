Of course, I should have expected that, like the Wii browser, external media (MP3s, MOVs, etc.) won't play.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com">The you tubes</a> also don't work because of Flash version issues.  Couple these problems with a slew of layout and Javascript rendering errors and you've got one of the poorest browsers out there.  Don't even start with me about the handwriting "recognition" interface.

There is a limited utility simply for <i>having</i> a portable browser, but for casual browsing this is no good.
