This month's Nintendo Power has a short preview feature on BWii, which, aside from some bare plot hints and a unit overview (naval units having already been revealed last year), confirms <i>online multiplayer</i>.  Two players can play online in three different modes: a co-op objective battle, a competitive objective battle, and an all-out skirmish.  Awesome.
