The same simple gameplay that I previously lauded is the reason I haven't picked the game up in weeks.  It just isn't engaging anymore.  It's fun enough, but gets old quick, and it doesn't help that the game itself seems quite long - 13 and a half hours in, I still only have three of the eight gym badges.  And the third badge was enough of a pain that I really don't look forward to the rest (I had to go through like three or four different cities to actually find the next gym leader, due to recurring "Sorry, but our gym leader is in another castle" scenarios).

I may return to it eventually, but I currently have no drive to continue this game.
