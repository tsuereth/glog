One of the best parts of SA/DX is how fast it can go.  With some exceptions (the excruciating casino stage, getting lost treasure hunting as Knuckles, and ... Big the Cat), it is possible to blow through Sonic Adventure in short order without too much trouble.  I'm far from <a href="http://speeddemosarchive.com/SonicAdventure.html">the best</a> at it but I do enjoy occasionally winding down a quiet weekend with an afternoon of Sonic Adventuring start to finish.

Something this game did that its followups failed to follow up on was streamlining.  The scenery is just as pretty, but there is no obligation, and even little motivation, to stop and drink it in.  Despite glitches and one of the most awkward cameras in the universe, finishing a stage in two minutes and only glimpsing its surroundings captures a great deal of the essence of Sonic the Hedgehog.
