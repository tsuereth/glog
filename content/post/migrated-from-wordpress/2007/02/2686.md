Definitely a good game, but there are some things really holding it back, which have thankfully all been amended in its sequels.  Some gameplay elements didn't sit well with me, like abilities that are poorly documented (I got a "super jump" less than halfway through the game but didn't know how to use it until just before the final boss), the crippled shop (my inventory is full of useless items that I can't sell), and the underwhelming extra modes after beating the game.

The voice acting is <i>terrible</i> - but there's not a lot of it.  The endings are also pretty meh, but it's not a big downer.  What gets me the most is still the technical limitations, and I'm really, really glad that the format changes saw that they never happened again.  The flaws definitely detract from the experience, but not enough so to ruin it; SotN is a fine game despite them.
