Long ago, in the <i>before-time</i>, I actually did manage to beat the entire StarCraft single-player campaign, without cheats even.  But a few years ago a hard drive mishap resulted in the destruction of these records.  Recently I've been feeling an itch to try again, and apparently I had already worked my way up to Terran mission 9 (there are ten Terran missions, then ten Zerg missions, and finally ten Protoss).

So I did Terran 10: The Hammer Falls last night, which I can still recall as one of the greatest challenges of my young video game life.  There were many setbacks to be sure (remember: Save Early, Save Often), but I eventually powered through, and wiped my opponents off the face of the map before destroying the mission-critical Ion Cannon.  They were quite helpless against my victory fleet of invincible Battlecruisers.

I still consider StarCraft's appeal remarkable, given that it is going on eight years old now.  The balance struck between complexity and simplicity is commendable.  (Where is the DS and/or Wii remake?)
