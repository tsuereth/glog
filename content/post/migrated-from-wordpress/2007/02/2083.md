Call me late to the party, but this is my first excursion into the world of Fallout.  I knew going into it that I would be playing an RPG set in a post-WWIII world rife with dry humor.  What I didn't know, or rather, what I didn't really think about is how much it has aged.  Fallout was first released in 1997: the same year as <game:Diablo>, and in many ways their antiquities are parallel.

Fallout is heavily inspired by classical Dungeons & Dragons RPG concepts, and unlike the simplified character system in Diablo that instantly drops the player into a click-and-kill dungeon, Fallout actually allows a full character sheet customization process (there are also premade characters available).  Some of the character attributes, like Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma, are just what you might expect; but then there are other cool thematic abilities, such as Science and Repair.

I'm not very far into it yet, but the mood is definitely morose and suitably post-apocalyptic.  There is not much depth of gameplay so far, but I'm assuming this will change when I actually begin to gain levels.  Surprisingly, the voice acting isn't bad, and could probably be evaluated as above average by today's (blech) standards.
