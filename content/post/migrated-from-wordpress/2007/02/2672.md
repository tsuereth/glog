Take a space shooter, and turn the spaceships into kids with laserguns.  Gunstar Heroes is brilliant in its simplicity and excellently tuned in difficulty.  Upgradeable weapons, constant crossfire, and <i>awesome</i> music make it a surprisingly addictive retro title, especially with two players.  I would rank it a Virtual Console must-have.
