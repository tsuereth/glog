A <game:Gauntlet>-style action RPG for up to five players.  Choose from several cool classes, including Fighter, Warlock, Elf, and Knome!  Use your class-specific attack (a colored projectile) to beat up enemies and destroy their spawn points.

Not much to look at, but Dungeon Explorer has some promise for multiplayer hijinks on Virtual Console.
