Some really cool side-scrolling shooter concepts are in here: neat weapon upgrades, a weird shield thing that can also dock to the ship as an offensive item, moving environments.  Unfortunately, contrary to my belief before purchasing it, the two-player is <i>not</i> simultaneous (you take turns).  Caveat emptor.  Nevertheless, fairly fun for what it is.
