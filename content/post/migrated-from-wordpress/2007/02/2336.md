Forgot to mention - the presentation is pretty cool, depending on how powerful your system is.  Stuff like full screen glow and ambient sound effects can make for total Tron immersion but they are a huge performance drain.

In the end I am pretty bitter about Tron 2.0.  All the pieces are here for a fantastic title, boring plot be damned, but the lack of appropriate difficulty balance (and my subsequent necessity to enable God Mode to get anywhere) makes it a non-game.  I bet there are real FPS pros and masochists out there for whom this challenge is perfectly feasible, but Easy Mode was not easy enough for me, and that's simply not fun.
