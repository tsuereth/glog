This is the best game on the Wii's Virtual Console, hands down.  The single player is your tried-and-true standard Bomberman fare, but the multiplayer - which you can play with up to <i>five</i> players - is nothing short of extraordinary.  The formula is simple (despite occasional stage gimmicks like conveyor belts and teleport holes), and is a wellspring of endless fun.  Not just good for a retro game, Bomberman '93 is currently one of the best games, period, on Wii.
