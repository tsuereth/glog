It's a little rough around the edges, but Streets of Rage is pretty close to what we know today as the modern Beat-Em-Up.  There are some weapon pickups and health items and so forth, multiple attacks (jump kick, suplex, piledriver!), and three ethnically appropriate characters with no real gameplay difference.  With two players, this is a great Virtual Console selection.
