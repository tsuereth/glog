This was the first Castlevania designed by Koji Igarashi, now known as IGA, That Crazy Castlevania Guy.

Take the classical sidescrolling Castlevania formula, and add Metroid-style overworld navigation, equippable weapons and items, and all-around badass Alucard as your main character.  Throw in a pinch of good musical composition and some awful voice overs and you've got yourself SotN.

It's clear what a giant leap forward this was in Castlevania history, but playing it now I can't help but recognize points of obsolescence.  It is interesting to see features like the two-handed equipment system that have not recurred in the series, but it is also easy to see why, as it does not really contribute much to the game.
