I made a new Draenei Paladin, and tooled around in the starting area for a little while.  The starter quests - like most others as I recall - have a real charm to them, and so far I'm really happy with it.  I've also inspected Outland a little bit.  Hellfire Peninsula is kind of dull; I hope I can get somewhere else.

Footnote: the download ended up taking only 6 hours, rather than 10.  I still think they need to work on their direct download reliability.
