After being stymied by the game's super-hard boss fights, I decided to buckle down and read a guide.  It turns out, I can level up my magic - very useful.  SoM is also one of those games that doesn't remind you of where you're supposed to go (it assumes I remember what the NPCs told me!), so a reference of what place to go to next is coming in handy.

It occurred to me earlier that the battle system in Mana, real-time party engagements with enemy creatures, was probably the largest inspiration for the [modern MMO](game:World of Warcraft).
