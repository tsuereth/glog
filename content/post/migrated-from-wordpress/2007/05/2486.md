I intended to do some Glog software work this weekend, but instead spent most of my time pseudo-adventuring around Outland.  The marketing of this trial is really quite brilliant - it prevents you from getting to or beyond level 61, which means that you can, with a little effort, <i>see</i> almost all of the new continent, but are unable to enjoy the overwhelming majority of it.  My taste has really been whetted.  I fear it's only a matter of time before it gets me again.

Fun fact: new Master profession level + Gnomish racial Engineering bonus = level 78 mechanical pets.
