I was trying to get perfect scores - which I remember doing in the [original](game:Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island) with much pride - but I got to the bonus stage in the <i>first</i> world, and it's ridiculously impossible.  There's rising lava, and enemies everywhere, and bullet bills, and coins in the middle of nowhere.  It's the kind of challenge that would be great to master, and I do intend to at some point, but currently there just isn't room in my schedule for this level of dedication.

<i>Progress: Total score: 2905</i>
