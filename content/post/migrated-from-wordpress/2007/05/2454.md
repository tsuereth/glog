I finally bit the bullet and clicked on the large Confirm button to begin my <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/trial/">10 day free trial</a> of Burning Crusade.  Then the page tells me I need to download a client updater.  This updater, through the satanic, dark magicks of the Blizzard Downloader, will have taken in the neighborhood of <b>ten hours</b> before it is ready to even begin installation.  This really only serves to remind of WoW's, and every MMO's, major failing in the subscription model: rather than paying for a product, one effectively pays for <i>time</i>, time which is already a volatile and precious enough resource.  The fact that I'm not actually paying is only a minor technicality.
