First thoughts: This is a really zany game.  Cartoon-inspired hijinx with rabbits and flying monkeys.  Kind of weird.  
Second thoughts: Early levels, the puzzles are surprisingly complicated!  
Third thoughts: Second tier of stages - this game is damn hard.

There is a good deal of charm in Zack & Wiki, but the best part of it, even at my early point in the game, is the incredible challenge.  The last level I did took like an hour for me to figure out.  And I think I've got at least 3/4 of the game left!  Very, very cool.
