The endgame collectible stuff wasn't really all I had hoped for.  For one thing, to get all of anything (e.g. "hidden treasures"), you pretty much have to collect everything (soundtracks and movies and all that).  For another thing, there is no reward except in the accomplishment itself, which would be fine if not for the utter arbitrary difficulty of several hidden items.

Anyway, the main game is fun, and for most people should be plenty, if not more than.
