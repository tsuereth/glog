Getting the game from my Capcom store pre-order was an ordeal, but I'm finally starting into Phoenix Wright's third installment.  There's been a lot of backstory-building since the first game, but Trials and Tribulations has done a great job of bringing me back up to speed.

I can also see that the action is really heating up; in the second case, I'm already running into a slew of hooks into the overarching backstory of Phoenix, Edgeworth, and the Feys.  Godot is shaping up to be an interesting character as well.  >!And what's really got me excited is the structure of case 2; I thought it was going to be over at the end of the first day, but some loose threads coalesced themselves into a dramatic turn for the case.  It's already got me guessing in a way that the previous games didn't really get to until case 4 or 5.!<
