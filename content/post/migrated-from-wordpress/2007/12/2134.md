This game is <i>pure evil</i>.  It's amazingly easy to pick up; even huge Normal-mode puzzles rarely take more than half an hour.  But at the same time, the nature of fast-paced step-by-step puzzle solving is super hard to put down.  I never thought a puzzle without rising or falling blocks could be so addictive.
