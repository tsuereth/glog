<a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clips/no-more-heroes-sinister-villain-getssinister-329883.php">This</a> may be the coolest game preview video I've seen in a long time.

Recent previews have showed me two things about No More Heroes-

1\) Graphical interface elements reminiscent of <game:Contact> (pixelated retro-throwbacks)

2\) Wanton physical violence

<b>Awesome</b>.
