I needed a distraction for my plane ride, and Picross is dirt cheap, so I decided to give it a whirl even though I didn't really understand how it worked.  The super-good tutorial brought me right up to speed, and now I've wasted a good part of the past three days making my way through these picture puzzles.

The puzzle mechanic is pretty cool, in that it's more logic- than [panic-based](game:Planet Puzzle League).  But the really amazing thing about Picross DS is the <i>amount</i> of content in it.  There are over 300 puzzles of varying difficulty built into the game, plus!, you can download more, and even make them yourself and trade with people online (the puzzle editor checks to see if the picture you draw is possible as a picross puzzle).

So while Picross DS is pretty good for puzzle game fans, I can see it being even better for people who just like to sit down and fill out a crossword or a sudoku, as this game will last them a <b>long</b> time.
