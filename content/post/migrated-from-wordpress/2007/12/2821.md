My second trial was interrupted by {{% game "Picross DS" %}}demonic tiles{{% /game %}}, so I had a spot of difficulty getting through it, but it's also worth mentioning that the plot of the case really threw me for a loop.  I didn't see the truth of the incident coming until it was right in front of me.

Case 3 is really interesting, and is operating as a showcase for the writing talent behind Phoenix Wright.  They've managed to fit in a wide spectrum of scenes and witnesses, and after two days of investigation, there are still a lot of mysterious unanswered questions.

But I really, really wish that, at least <i>once</i>, the word "than" would not have been misspelled as "then."  Like I said about Justice For All, it's obvious that the game's script was proofread by a machine rather than human eyes, and this is still a bit disappointing.
