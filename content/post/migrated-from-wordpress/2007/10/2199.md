According to the game's data record, my last accomplishment was in January of '02, when I beat Event Match 51 with no falls.  Back when SSBM came out I played the hell out of it - I got everything unlocked, including the totally impossible Diskun trophy.  I wasn't one of those die-hards who plays the game competitively and keeps track of move counters and priorities and crap, but I was very competent; now, realizing I haven't played in forever, I'm coming back like an elderly Sylvester Stallone.

I told myself I wouldn't start "training," and I still don't intend to, if for no other reason than because [Brawl](game:Super Smash Bros. Brawl) is still four months away.  But now that I've got a taste of Smashing again I'm really tempted.  It was a perfect game then, and my memories of it are beginning to return.
