Using the <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic07.html">Wii Remote</a> kind of sucks.  It's nice that the option is there, I guess, but it has all the problems you would expect - doing a Smash attack is inconvenient, not having a Jump button is irritating, and Dashing is a pain.  That said, it will probably work out as a good option for the family of four who has never heard of Smash Bros before, and has somehow fallen upon a copy of the game.

So I wish I had had a real controller, and I wish there was less control latency (this can probably be attributed to the early game build, or might also have something to do with there being a dozen other Wiimotes within 15 feet, causing an assload of Bluetooth collisions).  Another thing I wish is that I wasn't so damn excited for this game; the website's daily updates form an unstoppable hype train, but really, underneath the extra characters and new modes, it's still the same Smash that you've [already](game:Super Smash Bros.) [played](game:Super Smash Bros. Melee).  That's a good thing, though.

P.S. <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/ike.html">Ike</a> is a <i>tank</i>.
