Aside from being the only upcoming Wii game to speak of for the next several months, Super Paper Mario is shaping up to be nothing short of an <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/clips/clip-super-paper-mario-walkthrough-244050.php">awesome</a> game.  Whereas previous Paper Marios were turn-based affairs, segueing to a battle screen on encountering an enemy, SPM is a real time, action RPG where your hit points and <i>jumps</i> will become more powerful as you trounce foes.  There are a bevy of other features in here to be excited about, too, like more controllable characters, bizarre sidekicks, the dimension-change dynamic, and of course the wickedly humorous writing.  I can't wait.
