I hate to say it, but the Tron mystique is beginning to wear thin.  Plot related text and cutscenes are few and far between, and the light cycle arena is way behind me, with the vast majority of the game yet to come.  The subroutine and light puzzle elements are still here; but the shooting challenges are becoming very hard for me to keep up with.
