As I go on I'm finding Partners in Time easier and easier to put down.  I still like the core gameplay elements, although even with the necessary "Bros. Items" in gross abundance I rarely use special attacks; they are very difficult to pull off to the degree that they are more effective than regular jumping attacks.  Perhaps that's why the battles are beginning to feel like a grind, despite the wealth of variety in figuring out how a foe will attack and how to avoid it (or turn it upon itself).  I'm still holding out hope that this will change as I progress.

What bothers me the most so far is the long stretches of dungeon time.  Rooms are large, enemies are very abundant, and it doesn't seem like there are as many helpful NPCs (as in Superstar Saga) willing to endow upon the super brothers new field abilities.  Of course I can avoid almost all the battles and thus speed up the process considerably, but my #1 worry in any RPG is of being underleveled, so I find myself morally unable to do this.

In any event, I'm in the middle of a dungeon now, and can't wait until I get back to some witty repartee with the Professor.
