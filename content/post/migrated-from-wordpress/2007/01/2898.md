Initially I was wary of Elebits because of how much it looked like an insubstantial sandbox game, but based on the favorable reports of previous gloggers I decided it was worth a shot.  I'm glad I did because it's way fun.  I'm still getting used to the actual game mechanics and goals, but the physics of throwing junk around (and into other junk) is just too cool.

Graphically I'm reasonably impressed, though I think I noticed a bit of slowdown when a bunch of electrified elebits fell out of an appliance while other stuff was running around.  The sound effects are perfect, and the background music is made up of jazzy tracks that really set the elebit-hunting mood.

While by itself the story seems fine, and the art in "cutscenes" is pretty neat, I absolutely despise the voice acting.  But this is largely inconsequential.
