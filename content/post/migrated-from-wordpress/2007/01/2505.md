Thematically Scurge is a definite Metroid ripoff.  Female bounty hunter, hired by an intergalactic military, fitted with a high-tech powersuit, sent to a secret planetary installation to fight a rapidly-multiplying alien organism.  But it plays somewhat differently: there's very little jumping and puzzle solving, but a great deal of isometric 8-axis laser firing.  Yes, now that you mention it, the 8-axis laser firing is quite difficult to aim.

It's pretty simple so far, but in that there's a certain charm of dumb shooting action.  I wonder if it will last...
