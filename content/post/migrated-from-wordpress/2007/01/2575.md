So far - that is, in the intro case - the gameplay and writing is functionally identical to the first [Phoenix Wright](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) for DS.  In the words of Thomas Edison, "If it ain't broke don't fix it."

Justice For All has a modified soundtrack, which I had a little difficulty adjusting to at first, but is really just as rewarding as the original's.  I wouldn't even mention it except the music was (and is) one of my favorite things about Phoenix Wright.

The intro case is slightly longer than the first game's, which I believe is a sign in general that these cases will be more involved than its predecessor's (I've been informed that there are four, to the first game's five).  I've also already run into a few typographical errors and one obfuscated evidence presentation, but it's not enough so far to get me upset.

<i>Progress: Finished first case</i>
