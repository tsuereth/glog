Since I last spoke of the Wild World I began a gradual toning-down of my playing habits in it, eventually forgoing fossil collection, fruit picking, and even the weekly stalk market.  I finished building up my house, and put a few new items in the museum, but by and large I was pretty much satisfied with my work.

The last thing I decided to hold out on was to get a {{% game "Golden Axe: Beast Rider" %}}golden axe{{% /game %}}.  I completed the lengthy trading quest to get a Scallop item, which I held in order to give to town visitor Pascal in exchange for the axe.  More than two months later, I continue to hold this accursed seashell; despite turning the game on to check the seashore <i>every morning</i>, the scurvy bum has not shown up.  Thus I have finally resigned on this endeavor.

This leads in to one of my complaints about the game, namely that certain tasks take an exorbitant amount of time (and sometimes effort).  Certain aspects of the game are very pick-up-and-play friendly, and some others, like this big dumb axe, could really afford to take a lesson from that.
