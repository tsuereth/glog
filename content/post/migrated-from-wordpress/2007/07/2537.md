I finally managed to find another used copy of Chibi-Robo, and decided to take a break from [serious Disney business](game:Kingdom Hearts) to clean up the house a little.  I'm not entirely sure why - maybe it has to do with the familiarity of it - but games in a domestic setting (e.g. the inside levels in <game:Elebits>) have a real charm about them, such that even tedious tasks seem fun.  I think I've cleaned up around 300 floor stains so far!
