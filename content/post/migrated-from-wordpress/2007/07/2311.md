I haven't played a Pokémon since [Red](game:Pokémon Red Version).  And before I started playing Pearl, I was of the opinion that today's punk kids didn't know what the <i>real</i> 150 Pokémon were all about.  Now that I've sampled what the new iteration has to offer, I know better - it really hasn't changed at all.

This is good, because the core Pokémon game is simple and fun.  You've got levels and stats, types that are super- or not-very-effective against one another, and special abilities with different powers and effects.  Don't have the right type?  Go catch one!  The story?  Who cares!  Any excuse to have little creatures beat the shit out of each other is fine with me.

Sure there is more to the game than there once was - a clock, for one, with different monsters appearing at different times; more items, more types, more abilities, obviously more Pokémon.  And I'm sure there are a ton of special features that I haven't really bothered looking at.  But the basic gameplay remains intact, and, ten years later, is fun all over again.
