Unfortunately I still haven't figured out the convoluted airship hanger deal.  This is a side-effect of one of Kingdom Hearts' greatest strengths: pacing.  Even at times when the next goal is not explicitly declared, it is easy enough to figure out by wherever you haven't already been, and the game's events proceed one after the other in rapid fashion.  Never a dull moment.
