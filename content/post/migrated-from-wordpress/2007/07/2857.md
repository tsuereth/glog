Taking care of the Sandersons' house is fun at first, but after a while I felt like it was beginning to drag on.  Some of the goals for completing the main storyline were a bit cryptic and unclear; the amount of happy points that were necessary to reach the next battery level grew exponentially; and sometimes just finding things in the house was irritating due to them moving around from day to day.  But, on the whole, it is still a fun and really cool game.

Like I said, the end kind of dragged on a bit, but it's not a terribly long game: 10 to 20 hours, probably, depending on how much of the substories you're willing to invest in.  There are collectible "stickers" that don't really affect much - after completing the Giga-Robo story, your battery power is (literally) infinite - but signify other things in the game to keep you busy, like solving the problems of all the toys in the house.

A DS sequel, <game:Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol>, is coming out soon.  I haven't seen much of the game, but a lot of the fun of this one was because of the domestic environment; I don't know how engaging it will be in a primarily outdoor setting.
