I decided to finish the Mission Mode today, and definitely used some hints toward the end.  One of the missions was, here's a big stack of blocks, make a chain with red as the tenth matching color!  Jesus.

Where the Basic and Advanced puzzles are split into 60 individual scenarios, Mission and Active Puzzle mode are in six parts, each part consisting of ten sequential challenges.  It is possible to put the DS in closed sleep mode at any time, but you can't up and quit playing and jump back in the middle of the "mission" or "course," which makes it at least <i>seem</i> more intense.  What's more, the Active puzzle mode doesn't have any hints!

I'm only halfway through it and it's already starting to kick my ass.  Very cool.
