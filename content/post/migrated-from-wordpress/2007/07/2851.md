It's a real shame that massively multiplayer games have to have other people in them.  No matter how good Burning Crusade is - and it is good - it cannot overcome <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19">John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory</a>.  Even discounting players who are total asshats, there is no shortage of <i>bad</i> players, healers who can't keep anyone alive, tanks who can't keep a monster away from the party, damage classes who seem to have misplaced their damage abilities.  I know I'm far from the best Mage in the world, but some people I've grouped with for should-have-been-easy dungeon runs make me look like the goddamn king of Sparta.

Nevertheless I still enjoy galavanting around Outland, burning ogres and earning dough.  An aspect of BC that the designers clearly worked very hard to improve upon is endgame solo and small-group play.  As I have hit upon previously, there is a ton of stuff to do at level 70, and unlike the level 60 content in the original game, much of it seems <i>attainable</i>.  Whereas before I was a little bitter about bleeding money every month for little gain, I feel better about recurring payment this time (though I am still in my first month).
