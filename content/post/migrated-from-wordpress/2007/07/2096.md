I only played some multiplayer matches, so I don't know anything about extra features, unlocking things, online play, or anything beyond the basic game; but the game setup is really fun and easy to play.  The controls are simple: A for a pass (or to change players if you don't have the ball), B for a goal shot, shake the remote to do a tackle, nunchuk stick to move.  Yeah, there is the hindrance that everyone will need a nunchuk to play, but it is worth it.  This is one of those games that becomes exponentially better with more people.

The look and feel of the game is a bit weirdly futuristic, maybe a little on the x-treme side, but the run-and-tackle soccer gameplay combined with special Super Mario items and abilities is a real blast.
