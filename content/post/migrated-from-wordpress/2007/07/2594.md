I used to think I was good at the Panel.  When Hiroto showed me what a real block-swapper can do, I thought that, given time, I might be able to stand up to that skill level.  But now that I've completed the Active Puzzle mode I have glimpsed my limitations - and the miles of ability beyond them.

The early Active Puzzles are simply a test of paying attention, and introduce the idea of "cheating" the timing of the system to bring blocks to the right place at the right time.  The middle courses stress these concepts further.  But the last courses present challenges which I had to <i>pause</i> inbetween every block movement just to see what was going on, and even then I failed dozens of times on several of them.  The final scenarios consist of full or nearly-full screens of blocks, all of which must be matched and cleared <i>without stopping a constant stream of block matches!</i>  It is pure madness and I am amazed that I was able to survive it.

I now live in fear, in <i>absolute terror</i>, of the chance of encountering someone who is able to process such tasks naturally.  But I'll still keep PPL around for wireless multiplayer with my more realistically-skilled buddies.
