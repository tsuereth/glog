Plane rides?  Great for Pok&eacute;mon.  Got my second badge, and a kickass bike.

From the get-go it has not been my intent to "catch them all," or to become unendingly immersed in <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/07/11#1184175120">hidden game mechanics</a>, and thus far it is working out great.  The simplicity of the core game is great fun.

I named my Psyduck Qork, and my Ponyta Princess.  They are awesome.
