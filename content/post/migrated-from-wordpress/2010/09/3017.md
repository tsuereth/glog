What you might not gather from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ten-minute-taste-jurassic-the-hunted-154558.phtml">comedic gameplay videos</a> is that Jurassic: The Hunted plays <i>really</i> badly.  The controls feel clunky and unresponsive, the framerate takes a dive at the slightest hint of foliage (which is almost all of the time, given it takes place in a <i>jungle</i>), and the combat is just silly: since you have a gun, the only way for the dinosaurs to present any sort of challenge is for them to leap all the way across the goddamn screen at you.

While it does have its moments, Jurassic simply can't measure up to the terrible hilarity of <game:Rogue Warrior>.  At least, so far.  I've still got plenty of dino-killin' ahead of me!
