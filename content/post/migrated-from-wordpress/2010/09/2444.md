<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dead-rising-2/critic-reviews">The reviews</a> have made it clear that Dead Rising 2 is more of the same: a pleasant reward for fans of the [original](game:Dead Rising), but not doing much at all to fix its many issues.  I may not be as downright <i>mad</i> at this as I was at <game:Crackdown 2>, but it's an easy pass for me.
