Take the laziest possible copy of <game:Gears of War>, then add the terrible aiming mechanics of [Kane & Lynch](game:Kane & Lynch: Dead Men), <i>remove</i> now-common features like blind-firing from cover (!?), add a completely meaningless melee-combo system, and put a shockingly uninteresting level design around it.  That's Quantum Theory.

It's hard to believe how a reasonably professional publisher can, in all seriousness, release a game in 2010 that's nothing more than a <b>bad facsimile</b> of a game from 2007.
