I've been really looking forward to this.  I hadn't heard much good about Ninja Theory's [previous project](game:Heavenly Sword), but this one simply <i>looks great</i>: combat and platforming, a genuinely interesting story, and absolutely gorgeous artwork.

After playing the demo, I still think the narrative and presentation is fantastic -- but I'm concerned about the gameplay.  While it works, it simply isn't very engaging.  Maybe the combat becomes deeper as the game goes on; maybe the platforming and acrobatics become less familiar.  I hope so!  But now I'm in wait-and-see mode.
