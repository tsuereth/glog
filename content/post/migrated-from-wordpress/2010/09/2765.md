Though DeathSpank reviewed well, I was a little concerned about it being yet another [single-player Diablo clone](game:Torchlight).  Fortunately, it has a flavor all its own, even putting aside the thick, deadpan humor (and absolutely amazing voice acting, at least for the hero himself).  DeathSpank is really more <i>action</i> than anything else, and while the pause menu makes the RPG mechanics look deep, treating them like a side dish to the button-mashy main course felt surprisingly good.

I'll definitely get this, at some point.  Pretty sure it'll end up on Steam eventually.
