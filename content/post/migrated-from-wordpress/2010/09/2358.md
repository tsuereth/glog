The plot was laughable, and the final boss encounter was trivialized by our overpowered weaponry -- my co-op buddy and I agreed to let each other get the maximum point rewards in the last couple levels, leaving me with a Rail Gun that one-shotted almost everything, and him with a Golden Shotgun that pretty much obliterated the whole screen at once.

Still, the game was fun throughout, with combat that never got too intense or too boring, and platform/puzzle segments that were frequently quite challenging.  And it all worked surprisingly well, aside from a few nightmarish engine glitches (one time we clipped through a dungeon wall and apparently fell onto the reward platform in a hidden puzzle chamber).

I really hope Square-Eidos puts more muscle behind this "Lara Croft" spinoff franchise, as I'd love to see a more polished iteration of this game, maybe with more characters and/or simultaneous players.
