<game:MadWorld> was a fun, if insubstantial, experiment; <game:Bayonetta> did nothing for me.  So the Platinum Games pedigree didn't necessarily endear Vanquish to me.  But the demo is, uh, <i>pretty</i> impressive.

At first blush, you might think that a shooter combined with a twitch action game would just be one of those at its core, with slight influences of the other.  But Vanquish really feels like a legitimate hybrid of two powerful genres.  I can take cover behind blockades, and speed-boost out to take pot-shots.  I can slow down time, <game:Viewtiful Joe> style, to shoot missiles out of the air.  And I have a shotgun!  Nice.

The bright effects and sci-fi aesthetic really help, too.  Despite the (intentionally?) cheesy dialog, the Vanquish demo totally succeeded in making me take it seriously.  As long as the full game doesn't grant/restrict character upgrades based on a performance score, I'll be pretty excited about it.
