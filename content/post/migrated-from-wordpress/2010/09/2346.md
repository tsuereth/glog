Tilting the stick 'up' to jump bothers me.  Otherwise, Muramasa's control scheme and battle mechanics are pleasantly sophisticated and varied.  The story is surprisingly vacant, insomuch as, after the first boss encounter, I still don't know the premise; there's a bit of intrigue, but Muramasa is definitely relying on the strength of its action gameplay to motivate me forward.

What worries me the most is the game's difficulty.  There are two options to start, and the default selection is the Easy one -- I selected the harder-sounding option, which isn't hard most of the time, but I feel like enemies do an inordinate amount of damage when they hit me.  At the same time, I wonder if the game would be <i>too</i> easy on the easier setting.  At least I have the option of changing difficulties in the pause menu, should I hit a wall later on.
