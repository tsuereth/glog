Winning formula for a co-op game mode:

<ul>
<li>Don't explain the game controls or mechanics <i>at all</i>.  Rely on one or more of the players already knowing what he's doing.  (Given the game's controls are already completely different from any other third-person shooter.)</li>
<li>Don't bother fixing obvious engine faults that get in the way of two simultaneous players, like not being able to re-use an environmental action (like climbing out of a window) until unreasonably long after the first player does it.</li>
<li>Fall back to the game's worst mechanic in the second level.</li>
<li>Throw in an impossibly cliched story about some black market nuclear warheads or something.</li>
</ul>

<i>Progress: Finished on Normal -- got to level 2 in co-op</i>
