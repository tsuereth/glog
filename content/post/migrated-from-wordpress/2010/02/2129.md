Jesus Christ.  This game is terrible.  There is really no redeeming value in it.

The characters are un-likable, poorly acted, and poorly written.  The story is a mess - whole chapters of the plot are clearly and <i>blatantly</i> missing, so by the end, it doesn't even make sense anymore.  The controls, as I've explained, are absolute shit.  And the game is wont to throw challenges at you that are complicated by the difficult aiming, along with the complete failure of all AI: enemy forces become stronger with numbers, not intelligence, and friendlies are just as likely of running into your line of fire, as they are of <b>shooting you</b> because you're standing between them and an enemy.

Getting caught in the environment, audio glitches, nonsensical fight scenes - the whole thing is a shambles.  <b>There is nothing to like in this game.</b>  Period.

<b>Better than</b>: uhh...  
<b>Not as good as</b>: basically, anything  
<b>How IO Interactive continues to work</b>: is totally beyond me

<i>Progress: Finished in co-op (escaped in the chopper)</i>
