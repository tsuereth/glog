I started playing this the other weekend, but uh, {{% game "Grand Theft Auto IV" %}}something else{{% /game %}} got in the way.  Not that it had a difficult time doing so - Radiant Dawn, at least so far, has really failed to ignite my interest.

Granted, I am definitely not a series fan.  I played {{% game "Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance" %}}Path of Radiance{{% /game %}} on Easy just to see the story, and go through the motions of the basic mechanics.  But comparatively, Radiant Dawn's narrative is really underwhelming; all the characters seem pulled straight out of the Big Book of Japanese RPG Tropes.

The gameplay is also boring me, not that that's the game's fault - since not only did I set it to Easy again, but I also imported my Path of Radiance save data, which gives a few characters in my party <i>stupidly</i> high stats.  They could play this game by themselves, if they wanted.
