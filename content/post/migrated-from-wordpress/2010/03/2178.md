Yeah, I'm done with this.  It didn't take long for the game to start to challenge me, and frankly, I'm not motivated enough to see it through.  The story just isn't interesting enough.  Parts of it seemed goofy, which I guess is the writing's fault, but there were also moments where I'm almost positive that the English localization wasn't giving me the correct impression.
