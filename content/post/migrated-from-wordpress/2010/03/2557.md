There is one good thing about Rogue Warrior: <b>attitude</b>.  It is basically a non-stop sequence of stabbing and perforating dudes, narrated by Mickey Rourke's superb cursing.  You'll never laugh so much at dead North Koreans as you will listening to this game.

Aside from that, though, it is terrible.  The controls are shoddy, the game balance is stupid, the level design (and checkpoint locations) are just <i>wrong</i>, and it's phenomenally short - I'm at the halfway point after about two hours - although that may actually be a good thing.

It's plainly evident from playing for more than a few minutes, that Rogue Warrior is not the game that it was initially designed to be.  Stealth portions, when they work, work well; it sometimes feels like a foul-mouthed [Metal Gear Solid](game:Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes).  But when you're detected, it turns into a shitty shooting game, where all the guns are terribly inaccurate, and cover frequently fails to <i>cover</i> you.

Not that I would have liked it much if Rogue Warrior was a completely stealth game.  But its split personality makes it successful neither as a shooter nor as a sneaker.
