When I ordered <game:Rogue Warrior> on sale (more to come on this one!), <a href="http://gogamer.com">GoGamer</a> threw in a copy of Maelstrom for free.  I only got a few minutes into it before I realized that the unintentional hilarity wasn't worth the effort.

The writing, the voice acting, the animation, the graphics, the sound quality - this game's presentation is abysmal.  Come on, 2007, you can do better than this!  As for the game itself, all I saw was a mediocre squad-based RTS with useless AI and baffling controls.

I'd say this is the worst game to have installed SecuROM on my computer, [but...](game:Alone in the Dark (2008)).
