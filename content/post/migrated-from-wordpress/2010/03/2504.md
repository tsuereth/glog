The final mission pissed me off a little - in part six (of seven), the game told me to fly my helicopter low and shoot at the target, which only got me killed.  In fact, I just had to stay alive long enough for the next part of the mission to start.  But whereas this kind of shit was commonplace in earlier GTAs, it's the <i>exception</i>, here.  So I'm not terribly put out by it.

It's been a while since a game kept me up all night playing, and GTA4 did it <b>twice</b>.  Of my 30 hours with this guy's story missions, I'd say at least 28 of them were an absolute blast.

This is the engine - and caliber of storytelling - that {{% game "Grand Theft Auto III" %}}GTA3{{% /game %}} deserved.

<b>Better than</b>: all previous Grand Theft Auto games  
<b>Not as good as</b>: in some ways, {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla{{% /game %}}, but mostly it's better  
<b>I'm more curious than ever about</b>: {{% game "Red Dead Redemption" %}}GTA4 on a horse{{% /game %}}
