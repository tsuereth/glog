Back when it was known as <i>Darksiders: Wrath of War</i>, and appeared to be a badass {{% game "Shadow of the Colossus" %}}Shadow of the Colossus{{% /game %}} <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/gc-2008-darksiders/38741">with a chaingun</a>, I was really looking forward to it.  Fast forward a few years, the thing actually <b>comes out</b>, and apparently it's a Diablo-inspired Zelda.  Which sounds less exciting, since Zelda clones tend to be pretty shitty; but actually, as far as I saw in the demo, Darksiders is quite good.

It does a lot of things - button-mashy combat, dungeon puzzles, Zelda items - but it does all of them well.  And it looks consistently gorgeous, too.  I was a little worried that the game would be too "edgy" for me, but the theme and story (again, as far as I saw in the demo) take a back-seat to the compelling gameplay.

Definitely going to pick this up at some point.
