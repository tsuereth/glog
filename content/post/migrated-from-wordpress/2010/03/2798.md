So I've been playing through the campaign on my own in Agent (easy) difficulty, and co-op with a buddy in Special Agent (medium).  <i>Both</i> have been frustratingly difficult - primarily because mission objectives are stupidly unclear, and the levels are somewhat labyrinthine.  Ten minutes in, we'll discover that we've failed an objective because of something we did that... well, we really have no idea.  I guess I underestimated how much of my previous success was reliant on the Players' Guide.

The multiplayer is still wicked fun, though, especially since it can actually <i>run</i> at a decent framerate.  I wish there was an easier way to unlock all the weapons for it.

To reiterate: the "Game" settings allow you to prohibit auto-aim in local or private XBL matches, but not in a "Quick" match (Game settings don't exist in that mode).  So much for quick play on XBL.
