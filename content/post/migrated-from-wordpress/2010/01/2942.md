With downloadable content streaming in now, I'd hoped that my friends would pick Borderlands up again; once you've played the game's most fun mode - that is, You And Three Friends Blowing Shit Up mode - it is difficult to go back to anything else (You're Alone In A Desert mode, or You Can't Trust These Public Game Assholes mode).

But my buddies have moved on.  So, I guess I should, too.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Diablo II" %}}Diablo II{{% /game %}} (great in a group)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "BioShock" %}}BioShock{{% /game %}} (not as much, solo)  
<b>There is a Firefly reference</b>: And it's awesome
