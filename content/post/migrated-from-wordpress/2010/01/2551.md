It's good to be back in Vice City.  The weather, the music, the straightforward game map - it's nice.

I've only just started in Vice City Stories, but I have to say I'm surprised by the vacuousness of the game's plot.  I expected something lighter than {{% game "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" %}}San Andreas{{% /game %}}, since this debuted on a system with basically no battery life; but between the low-key story scenes and the characters all having multiple-personality disorder, it's a {{% game "Grand Theft Auto III" %}}GTA3{{% /game %}}-caliber narrative, which is a little sad.

Other than that I don't have much to go on yet.  But I am looking forward to this game's big feature: <b>empire building</b>, which as far as I know, is like a combination of gang warfare from San Andreas and property ownership from {{% game "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" %}}Vice City{{% /game %}}.  F'in sweet.
