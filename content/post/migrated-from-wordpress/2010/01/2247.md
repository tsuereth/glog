<a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/hazard-vs-eat-lead/44815">This</a> is the funniest part of the game.  And a joke about <game:Mass Effect>'s loading elevators.  It doesn't get any better than those!  Unfortunately.

The last level did have a few humorous touches - jabs at game studio employees - but it in no way made the rest of the game, or even just <i>that level</i>, worth it.  Eat Lead may be a short game, at around 6 hours from start to finish, but is still <b>too long</b> for what it is.  The lame jokes and tiresome gameplay wear out their welcome within the first two levels.

Really.  Don't bother.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Kane & Lynch: Dead Men>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Fracture>  
<b>Instead of playing this</b>: just watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JJ3Y78">Arrested Development</a>

<i>Progress: Finished on easy</i>
