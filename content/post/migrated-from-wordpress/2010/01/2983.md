<b>Yes</b>.

There are three aspects of Desperate Struggle to consider.

1\) Fighting!  It's, uh, like <game:No More Heroes> - same ideas, but more refined.  I just got a beam sword that can stretch across the <i>room</i>.  Sweet.

2\) Not fighting!  The somewhat-tiring overworld from the first game is just a map screen, now.  And you probably know that the minigames have become <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/tgs-09-no-more/56737">retro-themed throwbacks</a>.  Also, you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkRSHFLLscg">play with a cat</a>.

3\) Writing!  The first game was over the top, and this one is over <b>that</b>.  Half the lines sound straight from a Tarantino movie.
