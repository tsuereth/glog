Corollary: playing Red Faction: Guerrilla <i>while drinking</i> is amazing.  The low penalty for dying (you restart at a safehouse with full ammo), and the fact that death is usually spectacular (e.g. a tower falling on you), conspire into something that's really incredible with even just a bit of artificial suspension-of-disbelief.
