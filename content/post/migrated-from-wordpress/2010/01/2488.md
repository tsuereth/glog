I'd been looking forward to Dark Void for a while.  It seems to hit all the vital points of a simple formula: <i>science fiction + robots + lasers + jetpacks = awesome</i>.  But the demo, I don't know - it just <b>didn't feel awesome</b>.  The controls were a little loose, which is one thing, but also the game's environments, the acting, the pace of the brief demo set-piece... I don't know.  It just seemed bland, and insignificant.

It's completely possible that the real, full game is better-scripted and -designed than this demo, and that my concerns are for nothing.  But the demo left me with a bad feeling, and Dark Void is no longer on my most-wanted list.
