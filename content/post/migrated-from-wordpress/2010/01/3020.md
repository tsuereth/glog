Mercenaries is a good game, and I had quite a bit of fun with it.  But {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla{{% /game %}} did most of what Mercs does, <i>better</i> (technical hiccups aside) - so it is hard to go back to it, now.

I may return to Mercenaries at some point, if I run out of open-world destruction games to play, but that's seeming less and less likely anymore.
