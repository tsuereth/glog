ilomilo isn't just a Lost Vikings-style platform/puzzle game with a sickeningly charming aesthetic and clever puzzle concepts -- it also has collectibles!  Well, not that many collectibles, but enough to unlock special stages and other bonus content.

It's pretty neat.  You should <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/27/get-early-access-to-ilomilo-on-xbox-live-right-now/">try it</a>!
