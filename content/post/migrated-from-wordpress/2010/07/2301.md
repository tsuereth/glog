Once I'd picked up the <i>hookshot</i>, it was clear to me that Vigil's wholesale copying of the Zelda formula was 100% intentional.  Which is why I was so thrown off when my next item turned out to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlzLqgvKKXM">the gun from Portal</a>.

Darksiders does a lot, but none of it could really be called its own.  For the most part - excepting a general lack of sidequests, the sometimes-repetitive combat, an underimplemented world map, and the way-too-fucking-long Black Throne dungeon - it's fairly well-executed, if extremely familiar.

The one thing that Darksiders can really lay claim to is its story and mythos, although it could have been done much better -- past the intro cinematics, and getting to know the NPCs, it pretty much puts storytelling on hold until the last hour or so, where the whole plot comes out in a confusing whirlwind.

Through the versatility of its engine, and the obvious thought put into its backstory, the Darksiders concept has a lot of potential.  I hope the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darksiders#Sequel">inevitable sequel(s)</a> mix things up a bit more, though.
