Alright, I take that back: Brütal Legend might have needed <i>two</i> more years in the studio.  Despite having finished the story in under seven hours, I got pretty bored of the game's sidequests; which is much to its detriment, because the good writing and killer soundtrack can just barely compensate for the core gameplay.

I threw in the towel and dropped down to "Gentle" (easy) in the third-to-last stage battle, because I wasn't good enough at the game to get anywhere, and I didn't care to get better.  I don't know if I needed more upgrades, or different tactics, or to work faster, or what -- I really have no idea.  For all the complexity of its stage battle sequences, Brütal Legend does a really poor job of explaining them.

So, let's recap:

* A mini-map with pathfinding and sidequest tracking
* More sidequests, and more unique types of them
* A fuller story (I never even saw huge swaths of the game's world map)
* A more gradual and complete stage battle tutorial
* Real, honest-to-Ormagoden rebalancing; stage battle combat is <b>too hard</b>
* I shouldn't have to <i>buy</i> the radio (even for free), it should be in from the beginning
* Try for a solid frame-rate
* Fix the annoyingly visible bug where an old subtitle shows up briefly before being replaced by a new one

Then this game would be <b>awesome</b>.

As it is, Brütal Legend is a short, interesting, sometimes fun, but ultimately mediocre experiment.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:CIMA: The Enemy>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Pikmin>  
<b>I wish</b>: real radio was as good as this game's

<i>Progress: Slew Tim Curry (on Gentle)</i>
