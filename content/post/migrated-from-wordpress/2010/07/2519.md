I have three problems with Darksiders.  One is that the jump button isn't responsive enough.  The <i>jump</i> button.  It's an important button.  I mean, it's pretty good -- but it could be better.  My second problem is that, in certain instances, the game's performance is not very good.  Fog and haze and explosion and transparency effects all going on at once, some frames get lost, and it's a bit of a shame.  (Basically, these are almost-trivial problems.)

My third problem is that there's too much combat.  Especially early on, the game can get downright <b>dull</b> as wave after wave of brainless bags of demon blood come marching into your sword.  Within the action-adventure genre, Darksiders definitely leans more toward action than adventure.

It's not a bad thing, since the combat is well done, at least once more moves and weapons arrive.  I just prefer more adventure.

The story and theme is a lot more prevalent than I expected, which is good!  The premise is genuinely interesting, and the voice work really sells it.  (Thanks Mark Hamill!)  The game's gorgeous art style and slick graphics do a great job too, performance notwithstanding.
