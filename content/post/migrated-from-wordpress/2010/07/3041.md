The back half of Winter of the Melodias sees a return of fresh, inventive mechanics, and the kind of simple yet clever puzzles that made the first game fun.  I got a vortex power that created a bunch of new scenarios, and at the end I got to escort a singing robot-king (?) to fight the boss.

<i>Melodias</i> ended up taking me about three and a half hours, but I feel like the first one or two were uninteresting and unnecessary.  The sequel may have been designed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LostWinds:_Winter_of_the_Melodias#Development">address length complaints</a> in the {{% game "LostWinds" %}}first game{{% /game %}}, but it really just feels like a boring introduction followed by the real adventure.  I would rather have just played the <i>good</i> two hours.

Which are quite good, by the way.  Lots of fun stuff in those two hours.
