I got lost in Maridia for, like, <i>a week and a half</i> because of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soUZ9gY4erw#t=6m20s">this fuckin' thing</a>.  I swear to god, when I Power Bombed it, it didn't break.  I had to use a less-powerful Super Missile instead?  And then there's the Maridia boss, Draygon.  Don't get me started on Draygon.  Jesus.

I can see how Super Metroid was one of the greatest things ever back in 1994, but 16 years on, its age definitely shows.  There're no two ways about the controls -- they suck.  (Space Jump?  Impossible!)  And the game has more than its share of hidden things, from boss techniques to <b>knowing where to go</b>, that are in dire need of a hint system.

Both of these issues were handily solved in <game:Metroid Prime> and <game:Metroid Fusion>.

So, sure, I can appreciate Metroid's roots here.  But I also appreciate the improvements that have come since.
