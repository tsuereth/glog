<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/39000/">Moonbase Alpha</a> is part of a NASA effort to make people (notably, young people) more excited about space exploration and development.  If you ask me, it's an utter failure.  You've <i>never</i> seen the moon as boring as it is here.

Being Unreal-based, it looks and controls a little better than you might expect from a game developed under government contract; still not as good as a real video game, but, hey, better than {{% game "Rogue Warrior" %}}Rogue Warrior{{% /game %}}.  The gameplay, though, is about as uninteresting as you can get.  Per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbase_Alpha_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>:

<i>As a meteor strike damages an outpost near the moon's South Pole, the player must take control of a member of the outpost's research team and repair the outpost in order to save the 12 years of research accomplished there.</i>

So the entire game consists of moon-jogging <b>very slowly</b> to different parts of a map, picking up equipment (one piece at a time), repairing parts, and fiddling with other doodads.  I admit that I don't have a full impression of the gameplay flow in my head, because as I was trying to explore the map, I "deactivated" my equipment case and it <i>disappeared</i>, leaving my only equipment resupply several minutes of slow-jogging away.

I have to give Moonbase Alpha a little respect for its awkward movement and tedious mechanics -- being an astronaut isn't all ice cream and blowjobs, and much of what the game simulates is probably well-researched and realistic (with the exception of some solder-bypass puzzles ala {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}Mass Effect 2{{% /game %}}).  But this is exactly why it doesn't work as a NASA recruitment tool.  Who would want to do this in real life?

If NASA wants to get kids excited about space travel, they should focus on the awesome results - like exploring distant worlds, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise">incredible photographs</a> - instead of on the hard, boring work it takes getting there.
