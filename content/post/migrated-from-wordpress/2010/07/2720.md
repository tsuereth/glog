<game:BioShock> didn't have much of a story in the traditional sense - other than Atlas, and some business with Andrew Ryan, it was more of a <game:Metroid Prime> affair: unraveling the mystery of Rapture.  <b>Forensic</b>, really.  The story was the setting, and it worked great.  But BioShock 2 has the <i>same</i> setting.

As such, it invents a new main antagonist to try and re-focus the story, but Lamb really can't compete with Rapture, and I already know all about Rapture.  Not that this is a bad thing, exactly.  Rapture is as moody and atmospheric as ever.  The formula still works.

BioShock was a good game, and BioShock 2 is more of it.  It's also, at least starting off, surprisingly challenging (on Normal).  So far I don't like the Big Daddy's drill and rivet-gun armaments as much as I would real guns; but the game is introducing new stuff to me at a good pace, so maybe something better will come along soon.
