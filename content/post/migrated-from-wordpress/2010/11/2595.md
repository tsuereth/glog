A Boy and His Blob is a fun puzzle-y platform game, but also interesting because of its old-school design methodology.  There are no in-game tutorials or explanations of the controls; there is a demo cutscene, but (so far) there aren't any story scenes or really any narrative at all; and the game isn't afraid to kill you, although it's also usually forgiving with checkpoint placement.

Though it can at times feel archaic, there is a real sense of nostalgia here, more so than in many other games that try to tug on our "retro" heart-strings.  Aside from the charming art style and soothing sound design, A Boy and His Blob is just what games used to be like -- <b>simple</b>, relying solely on a core mechanic and introducing twists at a constant pace.
