It didn't seem like Enslaved was completely finished -- the story's conclusion seemed abrupt at points, the last couple levels had way too much repetitive fighting and shooting, and I kept getting a considerable amount of upgrade orbs well after I was explicitly told "This is your last chance to upgrade!"  But, these rough marks don't significantly alter my previous opinions of the game: fun, with generally good storytelling, but ultimately not an exceptional game.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Ōkami" %}}Ōkami{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Darksiders" %}}Darksiders{{% /game %}}  
<b>Would love to see</b>: this as a movie/miniseries, instead (yeah yeah I know there are already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_media_adaptations_of_Journey_to_the_West">a million of them</a>)

<i>Progress: Finished on Normal</i>
