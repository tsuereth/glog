At least so far, I'm getting a very {{% game "Super Mario Sunshine" %}}Super Mario Sunshine{{% /game %}} vibe from Mario's intergalactic romp <i>part deux</i>.  If you think that's a bad thing, you're a terrible person; what I mean is, while Galaxy 2 doesn't <i>revolutionize</i> 3D Mario games - just as Sunshine didn't - it <b>greatly refines</b> them.  It lacks the "Holy shit Mario's in space!" effect that {{% game "Super Mario Galaxy" %}}the first game{{% /game %}} had, but the rate at which it introduces new mechanics, and ramps up its difficulty, is (no pun intended) <i>stellar</i>.

Galaxy 2 doesn't have a hub world - it has a world map, ala {{% game "Super Mario Bros. 3" %}}Super Mario Bros. 3{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Super Mario World" %}}Super Mario World{{% /game %}}, {{% game "New Super Mario Bros." %}}New Super Mario Bros.{{% /game %}} et al.  As I completed the first World* I instantly thought, "Man, I miss the hub."  But no sooner did I get my first star in World 2, that the game showed me a zoomed-out map to easily navigate between the Worlds.  It doesn't have the same sense of wonder that Peach's Castle or the Comet Observatory did, but it does streamline the action, which, given the <i>quality</i> of Galaxy 2's action, is just as good.

<i>* The "world" metaphor doesn't really work very well when each "world" is made up of several <b>galaxies</b>, does it?</i>
