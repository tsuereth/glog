<b>Last week</b>, when I was harping on about how <game:BioShock 2> should have freshened up its setting, <i><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/12/bioshock-infinite-preview/">this is exactly what I meant</a></i>.  It's pretty rare that a game will sell itself to me on announcement day -- kudos, Irrational.
