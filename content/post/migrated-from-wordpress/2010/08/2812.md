What's funny about Vampire Rain - well, aside from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLor-wtgpS4">this</a> - is how obviously it cribs from Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, copying wholesale sound effects and UI elements.  Making a bad stealth game <i>look</i> like better stealth games, and hoping no one notices, is pretty ironic in its own way.

Even from a $10 7-11 used game bin, this is a ripoff.  It's too long and slow to be [comedic](game:Rogue Warrior).  And it's too terrible to be anything else.
