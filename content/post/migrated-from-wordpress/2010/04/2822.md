True story: before the new {{% game "Punch-Out!! (2009)" %}}Punch-Out!!{{% /game %}} for Wii came out, I thought the franchise was actually about <i>boxing</i>.  I guess that's like thinking that Mario games are actually about plumbing.  Sounds pretty retarded when I put it that way.

Anyway!  Nintendo offered this downloadable mini-game <a href="http://kotaku.com/5314497/a-one+two-shot-of-doc-louiss-punch+out">as a gift</a> to people who've bought too many Nintendo games, so I decided to (finally) give it a whirl.  I have a new appreciation for the Punch-Out gameplay formula, but don't really care much for it - as a test of memory and reflexes, it utterly flummoxes me.

If you're a person who's good at video games, though, it seems like this (meaning, the {{% game "Punch-Out!! (2009)" %}}full game{{% /game %}}, not this borderline racist preview) would be right up your alley.
