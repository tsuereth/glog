Remember two hours ago, when I was halfway through the game?  Since then, I got a drink, tooled around on the web, <i>finished the game</i>, waited for my website to come back up, and then typed this.  I guess I just April Fools' pranked myself.

So yeah, my total completion time was somewhere south of 4 hours, even with numerous dies-and-retries in retarded chokepoints full of dead-eye Russians.  I won't even bother mentioning the countless minor issues with Rogue Warrior - except that it is <i>stupefying</i> how often reloads get cancelled - since, at their worst, they will only last a few hours.

If you're like me, and have an unhealthy obsession with bad games, this is a great one because of how short and vulgar it is.  Otherwise, just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsusJVaAWf8">watch the credits</a> and forget that there's a video game preceding them.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Kane & Lynch: Dead Men> (Rogue Warrior is funny!)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: real video games  
<b>Seriously</b>: watch those <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsusJVaAWf8">credits</a>
