I unlocked a perk earlier that makes me able to plant explosives, while disguised, without arousing Nazi suspicion.  I stole a uniform, waltzed into a rocket base, and proceeded to plant remote-detonation charges by every group of Germans I could find.  On my way out, someone saw through my disguise; so I took out my detonator, ran to a safe spot, and pulled the trigger.  The entire base lit up and all the Nazis were instantly blown to kingdom come.  (In so doing, I unlocked two new perks!)
