Lords of Shadow looks and sounds great -- the environments are gorgeous, the voice acting is fantastic, the soundtrack is <i>epic</i>, and the story seems genuinely intriguing.  It's too bad, then, that the gameplay is so rote and uninteresting.  Granted, Metroidvania was getting a little familiar, but you don't freshen up a franchise by turning it into yet another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMyMCVg28I#t=1m5s">God of War ripoff</a>.

If this becomes a movie or an anime or something, I'd love to watch it.
