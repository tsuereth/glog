<s>The <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/06/bioshock-2-minervas-den-review-turing-rapture/">Minerva's Den DLC</a> was sounding like one I'd actually strongly consider buying.  But then, nope!  <a href="http://forums.2kgames.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1208765&postcount=122">No PC version</a>.

I expect this kind of bullshit from <a href="http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/02/02/ubisoft-no-prince-of-persia-pc-dlc-for-you/">Ubisoft</a>, but come on, really 2K?  Not supporting a multiplatform first-person shooter's PC version is kind of inexcusable.</s>

Good news everyone!  <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/27/bioshock-2-dlc-and-patch-back-in-development-for-pc/">Crisis averted</a>.  Now, don't screw it up!
