Clunky aiming controls, a throwaway plot with gaping holes in it, impossible physics, laughable running length, incompetent AI, indecipherable design decisions (the health bar doesn't make any sense!), poor checkpoint placement, astonishing loading times, lack of gameplay variety, idiotic dialog, drab environments, last-gen graphics, stupefyingly repetitive soundtrack, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/12/bionic-commando-developer-grin-closes/">helped bankrupt a company</a> -- as far as really bad games go, Terminator Salvation is everything you'd expect.

If there's one surprising thing about Salvation, it's that there are <i>so many</i> parties involved.  There are like half a dozen development and publishing houses on this thing.  What the hell were they all doing?  Shouldn't at least one of them have said, hey, guys, this game stinks?

<b>Better than</b>: the movie, I guess? <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_4/">maybe not</a>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:T2: The Arcade Game>, real video games  
<b>Not as funny as</b>: <game:Rogue Warrior>
