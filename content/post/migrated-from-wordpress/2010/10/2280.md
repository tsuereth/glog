Apparently, Gang Wars can <b>only</b> be initiated from a bike.  So, not bothering with any more of those.  Motorcycles are <i>generally</i> better in Lost in Damned than they were in GTA4; specifically, it's more difficult to be thrown off of one.  But, due to the laws of physics, they still can't do high speed turns very well.  Cars are still more fun.

For that reason, and because the storyline is relatively weak - not to mention, a little spotty (it has a {{% game "Kane & Lynch: Dead Men" %}}Kane & Lynch{{% /game %}}-ian quality of some plot points being completely unexplained) - The Lost and Damned fails to meet the high bar set by the original {{% game "Grand Theft Auto IV" %}}GTA4{{% /game %}}.  But it's certainly still a good deal of fun, and worth playing if you enjoyed Niko's adventure -- not just for the intersecting story points, but also for the new weapons.  Two words: <i>street sweeper</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Overlord: Raising Hell" %}}Overlord: Raising Hell{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Grand Theft Auto IV" %}}Grand Theft Auto IV{{% /game %}}  
<b>If you thought bike gangs were scum</b>: TLAD <i>definitely</i> won't change your mind

<i>Progress: Broke into prison</i>
