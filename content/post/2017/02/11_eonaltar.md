{{% game "Eon Altar" %}}Eon Altar{{% /game %}} swings hard at establishing a next generation of digital RPGs; by putting your character sheet and controls on your smartphone, {{% game "The Jackbox Party Pack 3" %}}Jackbox{{% /game %}}-style, it <i>could</i> deliver on a true multiplayer approach to CRPGs like {{% game "Baldur's Gate" %}}Baldur's Gate{{% /game %}}.  Unfortunately, it strikes out due to numerous implementation issues.

First: There are <b>five</b> characters to select from, but you can only have up to <b>four</b> players.  <i>What up with that?</i>

Second: The phone app isn't all that well-made.  A party member of mine accidentally paused the game (for everyone) because he switched to another app while we were playing.  The UI is a mess, failing utterly at attempting to simplify a D&D players' manual; the number of menus you have to navigate just to use a potion is prohibitively inconvenient.  And the movement controls just aren't polished enough to be comfortable to use ("free" movement is tied to a very small margin of touchscreen space).

Third: Performance isn't adequate, or at least, not universally.  I played Eon Altar once with a full party, running on my Macbook; and later by myself, on a Windows PC.  My full-party attempt had noticeable input delays -- not a huge deal for turn-based combat, but very annoying when we were just trying to run to the next quest marker.

(My solo adventure didn't have these delays, but I can't speak for whether this suggests a problem in the Mac application or with the number of players.  I will say that the Mac version appears to have dramatically worse rendering quality, not just in terms of e.g. texture resolution, but in terms of <i>3D math correctness</i>.)

Fourth: The overhead camera does a poor job of zooming out to allow independent control of disparate characters.  You guys -- this is a pretty basic thing, for co-op games.  If a party member falls out of the viewport because they weren't moving fast enough, that's a problem.

Fifth: The game just isn't all that interesting.  Underneath all the menu complexity, and despite a handful of ingenious features (like asking players to speak their character's dialog out loud), Eon Altar takes place in a rote-sounding fantasy world and leans on well-traveled tropes for its character classes and abilities.

If it had been a flawless execution of a scripted, multiplayer fantasy campaign, that would be fine.  Or if it had been a flawed, but innovative approach to grimdark or cyberpunk or some other genre.  But Eon Altar, clever as it is at times, just isn't clever enough to deliver a memorably fun experience.

<i>Progress: Almost none.</i>
