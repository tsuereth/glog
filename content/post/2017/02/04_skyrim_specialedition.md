I got 100% of the Steam achievements for [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition), and I barely cheated at all!

* For <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Oblivion_Walker">Oblivion Walker</a>, I tried to re-do the "Waking Nightmare" quest (because I had picked the "wrong" outcome last time), but nothing I was doing would reset the quest NPC correctly.  So instead I gave myself a second copy of the Savior's Hide item, and that triggered the achievement.
* And for <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Achievements_(Dawnguard)#Legend">Legend</a>, after <i>finally</i> reaching level 50, I saw that this kind of dragon doesn't show up until level <b>78</b> -- so I just said "Fuck it" while cheating my level up 28 times.  (I still fought and killed the dragon!)

Of course, I also had to use console cheats in some non-achievement scenarios, <i>just to play the game</i>.  One incident I remember particularly well was in the quest <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Lost_to_the_Ages">Lost to the Ages</a>, where the quest NPC (Katria) got stuck, and I needed to manually tinker with the quest status in order to un-stuck her.

And there was one quest bug so heinous that I never was able to fix it, even with all the console cheats I could muster.  I am still a werewolf because the <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Purity">Purity</a> quest just doesn't fucking work for me.  Farkas says he'll meet me at the dungeon and then never shows up.

(In one attempt at cheating my way through, I got him to go to the dungeon and we killed the necessary monster, but then he became stuck as a follower who was unable to stop following me.)

Skyrim is a vast world full of interesting content to explore, and I love it.  Getting all the achievements and spending 180 hours in that world has me ... pretty satisfied, but there is still more content in here that I just might come back to.  That the game is <b>so</b> technologically flawed, and I <i>still</i> love it, is a credit to how well-crafted that world is.

Seriously, if I worked at Bethesda I would shut the whole thing down until their quest system had full coverage of build verification tests.  This shit is <i>gnarly</i>.
