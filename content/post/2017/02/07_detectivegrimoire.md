[Detective Grimoire](game:Detective Grimoire: Secret of the Swamp) has:

* Smart, engaging, and humorous writing;
* Talented rapid-fire voice-acting;
* A neat mechanic in its thought-assembling conclusions;
* Fun, distracting little puzzles;
* And some pleasant-looking pixels to stare at.

But it also:

* Underdelivers on that unique conclusions mechanic;
* Occasionally hides clues in obtuse locations, just assuming that you'll click on everything;
* Doesn't let you examine evidence when you're asked to present it (I forgot what all those items were for!);
* And takes too much of its time <i>showing</i> you the story instead of letting you figure it out;
* Right up until the end (only ~2 hours later), a poorly-paced gauntlet of tedious evidence presentation.

Grimoire has some narrative chops, for sure.  But it just isn't <i>implemented</i> as well as, say, an Ace Attorney.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Puzzle Agent>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (NDS)>  
<b>The ending was also a little</b>: ... bizarre.
