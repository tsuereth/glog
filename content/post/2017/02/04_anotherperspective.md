What I like about <game:Another Perspective> is that it's challenging.  It did a pretty good job of pacing its levels such that each mechanic was introduced casually, and their combined complexity ramped up gradually, to the point where I <i>really</i> had to understand how it all worked together to finish a level.

What made me bored of the game was that -- there weren't that many mechanics.  Where, for example, <game:Braid> kept changing and appending to its rules after each "world" of levels, Another Perspective only had one world's worth of rules.

(To be fair, I didn't get far in the "Mystery" section of bonus levels.  But it looked like this wasn't about introducing new challenges so much as cranking up the existing ones.)

It didn't help that the game's sense of narrative, self-aware as it was, wasn't very interesting.  There was some quasi-philosophical waxing on the nature of existence and sentience, but it was up-front about these topics not meaning much in the context of a puzzle game.

Another Perspective was fun while it lasted, but didn't last all that long (~ 90 minutes to clear the main levels).  And while there are more levels I could do, I'm just not interested enough to do them -- certainly not by the game's plain aesthetic and unmoving narrative.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Bridge>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Braid>  
<b>It's obvious, isn't it?</b>: That the visual style is aping Braid?  How the character's body and hair are animated?  It's not just me, right?

<i>Progress: Finished the main levels, lost interest in the Mystery levels.</i>
