On its face, <game:Dyadic> is a simple and clever puzzle-platformer for two players (or for one player, a'la [Brothers](game:Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons)).  What sells it - or what sold it to me - is how accessible the controls are, and how easy the game is to jump into.

And the puzzles themselves are pretty well crafted; never devilishly difficult, but just complicated enough to make you think.

But the experience ends up being brought down by overall bugginess: checkpoints restoring you to game-breaking positions, characters and items getting stuck in the terrain, sound effects spontaneously disappearing or becoming stuck.  It's not a well-polished game.

The experience wasn't helped by some glaring design flaws.  Chief among them, the camera zooms in and out automatically to show both players at all times -- so if it's zoomed too far in, the vital puzzles surrounding you will be hidden; and if it's zoomed too far out, you'll scarcely be able to tell where anything is.  Another issue that comes to mind is the continuous, disorienting screen-shaking earthquake effect through the first several levels.

That Dyadic is over almost as soon as it starts <i>might</i> be seen as merciful.  I finished the game and got all its achievements in 90 minutes played.  (Including time spent retrying broken levels.)

It's impressively fun, in its core conceit, but Dyadic is dearly in need of more development love before it could be considered a "good" game.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Eon Altar>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons>  
<b>At least it does shine at</b>: the ability to accidentally - or not-so-accidentally - kill your co-op partner.
