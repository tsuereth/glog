In the first few moments of {{% game "Kalimba" %}}Kalimba{{% /game %}}'s co-op, one player has one totem piece, and the other player has another piece.  They need to be moved in tandem, stacked in a particular order, and jumped with coordinated timing.  Simple, cool, fun.

It isn't long, though, before the game gives <i>two</i> totem pieces to each player.  And then - given that either player's pieces usually move at the same time - both players need to coordinate stacking <i>all four</i> totems in specific arrangements.

I feel like there must be some aspect of the controls I'm missing, because this four-part stacking just seems ridiculously difficult to me.  Maybe I'll try the single-player mode and see if it's more instructive.

Barring that, Kalimba is <i>hypothetically</i> interesting, but the fun is blocked by how hard these basic stacking operations are.

<i>Progress: Gave up in the second co-op level.</i>
