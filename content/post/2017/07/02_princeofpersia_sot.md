Toward the end, {{% game "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" %}}Sands of Time{{% /game %}}'s gameplay and scenario design shows its age poorly:

* As fights become lengthier and lengthier, you're more likely to run into issues with the rewind timer being reset.  In the elevator encounter near the end, I had a handful of rage-inducing moments where I could only rewind back to a point that was already too late to avoid death.

* And in the final sequences, no longer having the Dagger of Time makes parkouring around <i>surprisingly</i> frustrating.  The game spends hours getting you used to undoing your mistakes; and in its final hour, makes you resort to traditional checkpoints, instead.

But, all that considered, it's still quite good for a 14-year-old game.  Its peers, like {{% game "Enter the Matrix" %}}Enter the Matrix{{% /game %}} or {{% game "Tales of Symphonia" %}}Tales of Symphonia{{% /game %}}, would be lucky to have held up so well.

Hell, Sands of Time still has some things to teach modern games, particularly that the ability to rewind and try again is <i>really, really satisfying</i>.  But I guess everyone is into "rogue-like" permadeath now, so... <i>sigh</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Assassin's Creed II" %}}Assassin's Creed II{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" %}}Uncharted: Drake's Fortune{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag" %}}Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves" %}}Uncharted 2: Among Thieves{{% /game %}}  
<b>Just a reminder, Ubisoft</b>: We haven't seen the Prince since {{% game "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands" %}}Forgotten Sands{{% /game %}} in <i>2010</i>.
