Flying solo, <game:Kalimba> feels totally different.  I think that's for two reasons, one being the single-player campaign's "unique" mechanics -- like color-swapping, ice platforms, and anti-gravity.  I'm fake-quoting "unique" because, since I didn't make it very far in the co-op campaign, it's possible that these features would have popped up eventually.

But the other reason is that, like I complained about {{% abslink href="2017/07/10/eerily-reminiscent-of-tingles-catchphrase/" %}}last time{{% /abslink %}}, co-op's <i>fundamental</i> four-totem stacking mechanic is simply broken.  The timing and positioning requirements are just too precise.

One brain, using one controller, can <i>maybe</i> manage to coordinate two totems well enough for Kalimba's levels.  Hell, a one-player four-totem quadruple-jump would be hard enough.  But adding a layer of human communication to it, and still expecting timing with 0.1-second precision, is just cruel sabotage.

The single-player game was just interesting enough to see me through its first third; the regular introduction of new mechanics was neat, but the demanding platforming wore me down.

As for the co-op, I can only summarize it as unplayable.

<i>Progress: Solo, 33% (beat the first world/boss); co-op, gave up in the second level.</i>
