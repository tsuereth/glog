The <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/558420/">free demo</a> for <game:Stories Untold> conveys a few messages very powerfully:

1. These guys know how to write a creepy fucking story.  (I would say, moreso than <game:Until Dawn>'s admirable creep-factor.)  The combination of evocative text and well-directed graphical effects makes for a <i>very</i> powerfully-ominous presentation.

2. I am a scaredy cat.

3. And... I guess it's pretty short.  Of the four stories in Stories Untold, this first one lasted 20 minutes.

4. Also, phrase-based text adventures <i>suck</i>.  As creepy as it can be, trying to guess what keywords the game will parse really ruins the immersion.

If I was into being scared, I would probably be pretty enthusiastic about this.  But... since I'm not, the stilted design and apparent brevity is just icing on the no-thank-you cake.
