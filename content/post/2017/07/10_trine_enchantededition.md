[Eight years ago]($SiteBaseURL$2009/08/22/trine-4/), I pointed out a critical flaw in <game:Trine>'s co-op experience: the game isn't <i>really</i> designed for it -- and most obstacles don't accommodate multiple players.

While <game:Trine Enchanted Edition> may be prettier than the original, it doesn't solve this problem.

Trine is still fun to stumble through with a friend's help - or alternatively, fun to make your friend stumble through by accident - but isn't quite "enchanted" enough to motivate a full run.  Plus, as I [once lamented]($SiteBaseURL$2014/07/31/trine-trine-again/) on <game:Trine 2>, the "floaty platforming and shoddy hit-detection" aren't as easy to live with as they used to be.

<i>Progress: Gave up at Fangle Forest</i>
