At least so far, <game:Shenzhen I/O> feels a lot like a direct sequel to <game:TIS-100>.  It's focused a little less on raw computation, and more on connectivity, in order to integrate with other components; but I'm still writing assembly-like code, blocking on inputs from other processors' outputs, and wrangling tiny amounts of runtime memory.

Time will tell, but at this point Shenzhen feels like a simpler game than its forebears, with puzzles that are more "cool" than puzzling.

Minor digression, but <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/570490/">the solitaire minigame</a> is total bullshit.  The unstackable "dragon" cards really ruin it.  I guess I'm supposed to fully analyze the card layout before making a hasty play; but <i>ugh</i>.
