<game:Pitfall Planet> is the endearing story of two simple robots trying to repair their spaceship, by harvesting ore from co-operative puzzle-platform levels.

As in any successful co-op game, you can grab and throw your fellow robot, over an obstacle -- or off of a cliff.

The majority of the levels aren't hard on their own, but revolve around basic coordination tactics.  You throw me over this pit, I grab this item and throw it to you, you use the item to hit a switch, I go up this platform to hit another switch... and so on.

That said, there have been a couple levels that stumped me and my companion for quite some time: like a giant Rube Goldberg device, or a falling floor-tile maze over a pit of lava.  And although most of the game's difficulty is in figuring out what to do, there are occasional challenges of timing as well (like running away from tiny drill robots).

Pitfall Planet really excels at encouraging teamwork in solving puzzles, helped by an engaging soundtrack and a slightly-mysterious world design.  (I hope, before the game ends, we discover what happened to this planet's previous inhabitants.)
