The previous Headhunter packs were holiday-themed.  {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax" %}}Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax{{% /game %}} looks like it <i>was</i> going to be for Easter - there's a "fertility event" and there are a bunch of pastel-colored eggs - but then they lost interest, and dropped the holiday connection altogether.

But that's not important.  What is important, is that Wam Bam Island is <b>gorgeous</b>.  White, sandy beaches lit by a clear, bright sky, peppered with hostile pirates and crab monsters ("craboids").  Two parts of the map are connected by an underwater tunnel, which is, as we all know, the coolest part of any aquarium.

Also important: since it pulls in the whole Vault Hunter cast, the background banter is pleasant and entertaining to listen to -- a distinct strength, compared to {{% game "Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" %}}Marcus's{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre" %}}Moxxi's{{% /game %}} packs.  I really had fun romping around the island while Lilith fawned over Mordecai's new hunting pet.

Of course, it's still all over before you know it.  But among the mostly-underwhelming group of Headhunter packs, the eye- and ear-candy definitely makes this one of the good ones.
