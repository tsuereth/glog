I'd been looking forward to <game:Death Squared>, thinking that it looked like a fun co-op puzzler in the vein of <game:Pitfall Planet>.  Good thing I tried the demo, first.

Death Squared seems not as much to be a thoughtful, methodical puzzle game, as it is a die-and-retry, getting-punched-in-the-face kind of puzzle game.

At least in two-player mode, levels are scripted such that each player's movement basically fucks the other player over.  So the solution to a level will require the Red player to move to one position, then the Blue player to move to another position, then Red to move again, and Blue, and ... so on.  Moving to a non-ideal position, and/or moving while your counterpart isn't standing in the right place, will result in someone being killed and the level restarting.

Naturally, <i>discovering</i> these traps tends to involve being killed by surprise and having to restart from scratch.

By myself, controlling both characters with one brain, I couldn't even make it through the whole demo.  I can only imagine that in co-op, Death Squared would incur even more severe coordination frustration than what drove me to give up on <game:Kalimba>.
