{{% game "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep" %}}Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep{{% /game %}} - between its irreverent Dungeons &amp; Dragons parody, reunion of favorite characters, and really, actually well-crafted questing content - is a thankful return to form for {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}, after {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt" %}}Sir Hammerlock{{% /game %}}'s disappointing DLC.

It's not perfect, as some combat sections drag on a bit, and the ending is kind of a let-down.  (Par for the course in {{% tag "Borderlands" %}}Borderlands{{% /tag %}} games, apparently.)  But it's definitely the best post-game that Borderlands 2 has to offer.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty" %}}Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: the main game of {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}  
<b>But we're not done yet</b>: I never played {{% game "Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest" %}}Bloody Harvest{{% /game %}} or the other Headhunter DLCs, before.

<i>Progress: Finished the main quest, and almost all sidequests.</i>
