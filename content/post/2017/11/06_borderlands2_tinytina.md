[Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep](game:Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep) - between its irreverent Dungeons & Dragons parody, reunion of favorite characters, and really, actually well-crafted questing content - is a thankful return to form for <game:Borderlands 2>, after [Sir Hammerlock](game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt)'s disappointing DLC.

It's not perfect, as some combat sections drag on a bit, and the ending is kind of a let-down.  (Par for the course in <tag:Borderlands> games, apparently.)  But it's definitely the best post-game that Borderlands 2 has to offer.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: the main game of <game:Borderlands 2>  
<b>But we're not done yet</b>: I never played [Bloody Harvest](game:Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest) or the other Headhunter DLCs, before.

<i>Progress: Finished the main quest, and almost all sidequests.</i>
