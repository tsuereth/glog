And now the Headhunter packs are up to Valentine's Day, with {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre" %}}Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre{{% /game %}}.

Like the previous packs, there's a single main quest that runs through the map, and a single follow-up sidequest that retreads the same ground.  And, like the previous packs, it offers some brief glimpses of {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}'s quality, crass humor.  (There is a robot named Innuendo-bot.)

But Mad Moxxi, as the title character for this pack, really feels like she's phoning it in.  The plot by itself isn't interesting, and she doesn't add any flavor to it.  All she does is tell you to go to X and do Y.

The high point of this DLC is about 30 seconds worth of banter between Moxxi and Ellie.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest" %}}Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" %}}Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day{{% /game %}}  
<b>Innuendo-bot</b>: deserved better.
