Nine DLCs and 70-odd hours later, {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}} does ultimately run out of steam.  My few remaining quests are mostly of the Raid and/or Level 50 variety - plus a few tiresomely-repetitive combat arenas - and I'm not really stoked on starting the whole game over again for True Vault Hunter Mode.

But Borderlands 2's weak transition into "endgame" is softened considerably by the incredible volume of content leading up to it.  And aside from a few disappointing DLCs, that content remains commendable for its blend of engaging action, compelling loot, and genuinely funny writing and acting.

I'll probably get to {{% game "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" %}}the Pre-Sequel{{% /game %}} after leaving my Borderlands itch un-scratched for a few months.  In the meantime, I'm still hoping for that Mr. Torgue spinoff franchise.
