Like the preceding [Thanksgiving story](game:Borderlands 2: The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler), the Christmas tale [How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day](game:Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day) is a short and sweet tidbit of <game:Borderlands 2> content.

The snowy holiday-themed environment is charming, if small.  To its credit, unlike [Bloody Harvest](game:Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest) it isn't so large and empty that it feels painful to run through.

But, it also just isn't as interesting as Mr. Torgue's explosive feast.  Marcus is an amusing character, but he doesn't <i>drive</i> this plot.  It's more driven by an evil, Grinch-like snowman.  Who you then kill.

And like the other Headhunter packs, it's shockingly short, like 30-60 minutes including both its main quest and a single sidequest.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler>  
<b>As a reminder</b>: these packs released at $2.99, which feels like a stretch for less than an hour of content.
