Mr. Torgue is here again to save the day!

{{% game "Borderlands 2: The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler" %}}Borderlands 2: The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler{{% /game %}} is a full-on redemption for the "Headhunter" DLCs, after {{% game "Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest" %}}T.K. Baha{{% /game %}} made such a mess of things.

One: It's got Mr. Torgue.  SQUIBBLYBAMBLYMEEDLYMOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!

Two: It's short, but in the "skirt analogy" sense -- it's <i>just long enough</i>.

Three: There's a fair amount of pop-culture parody even in its brief (less than an hour) main quest.  Some <i>The Hunger Games</i> stuff, there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Chef">Swedish Chef</a>, "Chef Gouda Remsay" ... okay, maybe not much.  But it's something!

And four: You blow up a giant turkey.  As is tradition.

... and then there's Grandma Flexington's sit-and-listen story quest, which is an enormous waste of time but is still funny in a subversive, masochistic kind of way.

Wattle Gobbler makes the case for short, funny additions to {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}.  Here's hoping for more like this.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest" %}}Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" %}}Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage{{% /game %}}  
<b>I really wonder</b>: how much mileage Gearbox could get out of a Mr. Torgue spinoff game?
