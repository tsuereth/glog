Well, I can take back what I might have said about {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt" %}}Sir Hammerlock{{% /game %}} having the worst {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}} DLC.  {{% game "Borderlands 2: T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest" %}}T.K. Baha's Bloody Harvest{{% /game %}} is the new low point.

T.K. Baha, even as a zombie, is an incredibly uninteresting character.  His voice actor sounds bored the entire time.

There are some new enemies, in the form of walking pumpkins; but most of the DLC is filled with skeletons, who we <i>just</i> fought a <i>ton</i> of in {{% game "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep" %}}Dragon Keep{{% /game %}}.

The main quest is dull, and once that's done, T.K. gives you a sidequest to traverse the whole map a second time.  <i>Ugh.</i>

And even though it's shockingly short, like an hour at most, it feels too long.  Like 15 minutes of content was stretched over too large a map.

This makes a very poor first impression for Borderlands 2's "Headhunter" mini-DLCs.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice - Phoenix Wright: Asinine Attorney" %}}Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice - Phoenix Wright: Asinine Attorney{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: seriously, {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt" %}}Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt{{% /game %}}  
<b>Please, please</b>: let {{% game "Borderlands 2: The Horrible Hunger of the Ravenous Wattle Gobbler" %}}the next one{{% /game %}} be better.
