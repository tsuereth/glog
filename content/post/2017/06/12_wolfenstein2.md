So [The New Colossus](game:Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus) takes [New Order](game:Wolfenstein: The New Order)'s alternate-history resistance to the Nazi empire, and moves it to America?  One, please.

I only hope that New Colossus can meet the storytelling bar set by its predecessor -- and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHht8480cEo">the trailer</a> shows some great potential.
