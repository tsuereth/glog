[Burial at Sea - Episode 2](game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 2) does a much, <i>much</i> better job of delivering a coherent gameplay experience than [the first episode](game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1) did.  It's still not as good, mechanically, as [BioShock](game:BioShock Remastered) proper: "hacking" is still dumbed-down, there's really only one good plasmid, side-quests are surprisingly lacking (so many empty rooms!), and enemy encounters aren't varied enough to hold up a full-length game.  But it works.

Unfortunately, just as in <game:BioShock Infinite>, the main attraction here is the story -- and that story leans heavily on <i>shocking revelations</i> about the links between Rapture and Columbia.  Revelations which are no longer shocking in a second playthrough.

Burial at Sea still feels like a fitting narrative epilogue to BioShock Infinite; but I don't think there's any reason to play it more than once.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:BioShock Infinite>  
<b>As for Irrational Games</b>: now "Ghost Story Games," well... we'll see.
