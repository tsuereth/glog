I solved enough of the puzzles in {{% game "Infinifactory" %}}Infinifactory{{% /game %}}'s last level to look ahead to the game's ending -- or, what I thought was the ending.  Apparently it really just unlocked <i>the second half of the game</i>.

I mean, I'm not going to complain about more puzzles, so long as they continue to present new and interesting challenges.  But I am starting to feel a bit worn out.  More so than in {{% game "SpaceChem" %}}SpaceChem{{% /game %}} and {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}}, Infinifactory's solutions require a considerable amount of <i>work</i> to implement -- due to having to manage moving parts and equipment in 3D space.

And as the puzzles become more complex, a surprising challenge has emerged: being able to move the avatar around the puzzle, and reach equipment you need to manipulate.  I'd much rather that the avatar had no collision physics, so I could more easily debug my increasingly tightly-packed machinery.

Also, I was really hoping to close the book on this and move ahead to {{% game "SHENZHEN I/O" %}}SHENZHEN I/O{{% /game %}}.  Oh, Zachtronics, you spoil me so.
