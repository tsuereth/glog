<game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time> is one of those games that sticks out prominently in my memory.  Although I've had a [rough](game:Red Dead Redemption) [time](game:BioShock Infinite) with some of those recently -- the Prince has weathered time fairly well, if not entirely unscathed.

Starting the game on my PC, the first issue I encountered was that everything looked like one big <i>blur</i>.  I guess that sometime in the past decade or so, the GPU technique that these guys used for fog has become deprecated or broken; with fog turned on in graphics options, it is impossible to see a goddamn thing.  Turned it off.  I can see!

Second issue: my Xbox 360 controller doesn't work.  Sands of Time has "Gamepad" options, but here is where I remember: it was released well before the <platform:Xbox 360> existed.  Had to map all of the buttons manually.  Slightly annoying, but now we're off!

The Prince starts telling his tale, and ... oh, there are no subtitles.  There is no <i>option</i> for subtitles.  That's unfortunate.

Aaaand now we're in the game proper!  Huzzah!... well, the controls and camera movement suck a little bit, don't they?  The Prince can't just start running, he needs to wind-up his speed first, which is somewhat irritating.  The camera can get pretty spastic when going through some doorways or rounding certain corners.  And the timing necessary for pulling off wall-jumping seems more punishing than it should be.

And, okay, fights are a bit dull.  Generally speaking, the game uses a quantity-over-quality strategy of throwing enemies at you.  (A flaw that I remember [the sequel](game:Prince of Persia: Warrior Within) attempted to address.)  And the battle music gets repetitive quite fast.

<i>All that aside</i> -- this is still a great game.  The story is well-told (and well-acted!), the parkour gameplay is fun, and the environments are beautiful and memorable.

What I'm finding really incredible about re-treading Azad is that I still recognize practically all of the game's levels when I see them; this game made a strong impression on me, circa 2003-2004, and that impression is holding up.

<i>Progress: 62\%</i>
