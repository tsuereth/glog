{{% game "BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1" %}}Burial at Sea - Episode 1{{% /game %}} <i>still</i> suffers from an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/8870/discussions/0/666826069103430379/">easily-reproducible, game-breaking bug</a> -- one which happens to highlight the folly of infrequent autosaves.  Granted, Irrational Games only really had three months to fix it before being effectively shut down.  But it only feels <i>more</i> biting, four years later.

That aside, Burial at Sea's first episode remains a short, sloppy, and mediocre story, married to a very poor gameplay direction (restricting my ammo doesn't make the shitty stealth any better!).  It would be outright <i>bad</i> if not for the ending, which isn't that satisfying by itself, but does add a little flavor to {{% game "BioShock Infinite" %}}BioShock Infinite{{% /game %}}'s conclusion.
