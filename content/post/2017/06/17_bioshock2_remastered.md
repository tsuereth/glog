Seven years later, {{% game "BioShock 2 Remastered" %}}the remaster{{% /game %}} doesn't really change my final thoughts on {{% game "BioShock 2" %}}BioShock 2{{% /game %}}.  The early game - relying as it does on "Big Daddy" mechanics to pull you in - is perhaps weaker than before, since video games have moved on somewhat.  But ultimately, {{% game "BioShock" %}}BioShock{{% /game %}}'s sequel both thrives and suffers for its narrative attachment to the original.

The theme and plot of BioShock 2 succeed in drawing from the well that Andrew Ryan and "Would You Kindly" had already established; but fail to make an impression that really feels unique.

What BioShock really needed wasn't an additional story about Rapture in the 1960s, but something more <i>ambitious</i>.  I guess Ken Levine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite#Development">knew that all along</a>.

All that said, BioShock 2 is certainly a fun and entertaining game; and while it sure would have been <i>nice</i> for the remaster to fix the game's console-first UI (and its reluctance to autosave), the modern visual treatment holds up just fine.
