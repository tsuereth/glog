<game:BioShock Infinite> still managed to feel good, in the end.  But not as good as it felt the first time.

Infinite's value as a game is based <i>almost completely</i> around the strength of its shocking ending; so, knowing what was coming ahead of time dulled it a little.  And this time around, I wasn't quite as anxious to forgive the game's first half being so unengaging and uninteresting.

Still, the narrative power of BioShock Infinite is hard to overstate, even with the benefit of hindsight.  I hope Ken Levine feels proud of the story he was able to tell.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:BioShock 2 Remastered>, even though Infinite's gameplay mechanics are definitely not as good.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: maybe <game:Wolfenstein: The New Order> (I'm waffling between the two).  
<b>Almost done with the BioShock reunion tour</b>: Just got to go [back to Rapture](game:BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1) <i>yet again</i>
