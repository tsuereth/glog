Maybe I'm the only person on Earth who played {{% game "Beyond Good &amp; Evil" %}}Beyond Good &amp; Evil{{% /game %}} and didn't like it.  Over a decade later, all I can say is that it was profoundly un-memorable; the story wasn't noteworthy and the gameplay was very routine.

(I <i>do</i> remember that {{% game "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" %}}Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time{{% /game %}} came out around the same time, and <i>that</i> game was super frickin' sweet.)

So it's doubly mystifying to me how the no-gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAYN08YoaV8">prequel trailer</a> is driving so much hype.  Is it because the monkey says "motherfucker?"  It certainly can't be because of the hackneyed and Michael Bay-esque police chase.

Maybe if I could borrow {{% abslink href="2017/04/13/banjo-timewarpey/" %}}Playtonic's time machine{{% /abslink %}}, I could go back to 2004, play BG&amp;E again, and try to understand why the game became so beloved.  For now, I don't remember the game as anything but wholly unremarkable.
