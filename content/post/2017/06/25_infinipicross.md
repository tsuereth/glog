{{% game "InfiniPicross" %}}InfiniPicross{{% /game %}}'s puzzles don't "look like" anything; they're randomly generated.  To me, this isn't a weakness at all.  The puzzles could look like Rorschach tests or traffic accidents for all I care; I just want to fill them out.

If all I had to do for the rest of my life was solve nonograms, InfiniPicross could facilitate that pretty well.  But I do occasionally have to eat, sleep, and watch television.  So the game's promise of "infinite" puzzles wasn't really what impressed me.

It was the fact that I generated a <b>99 x 50</b> puzzle - <i>obliterating</i> the 40 x 30 size record from {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}} - and took <i>over three hours</i> to solve it.

Even if I never start the game up again, that solve alone feels well worth InfiniPicross's paltry asking price.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Pokémon Picross" %}}Pokémon Picross{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}}, just because I do like a scripted "campaign" of puzzles to solve.  
<b>It can generate up to 99 x 99</b>: but I think I'll need a bigger monitor (and probably a full day) to pull that off.
