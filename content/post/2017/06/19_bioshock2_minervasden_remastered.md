[Minerva's Den Remastered](game:BioShock 2: Minerva's Den Remastered) is a ... nice freebie, I guess; but beneath its modernized appearance, the game itself is a bit scatterbrained, and overall unimpressive.

The first of its three levels feels like an experiment in non-linear design, which mostly failed.  The new laser weapon is underwhelming, and the focus on flying robot buddies fails to address their annoyances (when they block your path, or block your bullets).  The pacing is obviously and somewhat deliberately broken, in its attempt to accelerate the delivery of the same arsenal that <game:BioShock 2> accumulated over a much longer game.

Oh-- I've {{% abslink href="2011/06/12/bioshock-2-minervas-den-4/" %}}already written all this{{% /abslink %}}, haven't I.

Well, yeah.  It's like I said in 2011, then.  Pretty "meh."

Uninteresting sidenote: In this post-<game:Dear Esther> world, the walking-through-narrative-voiceovers ending sequence of Minerva's Den clearly sets the stage for what we now call a Walking Simulator.

<b>Better than</b>: [Asinine Attorney](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Phoenix Wright - Asinine Attorney)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:BioShock 2 Remastered>  
<b>The best part</b>: feeling free to move on to <game:BioShock Infinite>
