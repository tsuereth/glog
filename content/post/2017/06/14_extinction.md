There are already some big things I'm worried about from the <game:Extinction> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBJw7I-CrXQ">gameplay presentation</a>: like the balance of grinding through trash mobs versus "real" combat with ogres, and how important checkpoints will be if the ogres can kill you in one hit.

But it's also ticking some important boxes for me.  The traversal mechanics are robust, and flitting around rooftops and giant ogres looks super fun (with more freshness than [Assassin's Creed: Pyramids](game:Assassin's Creed Origins)).  And the ogre fights have a shade of <game:Shadow of the Colossus> to them (for which I have more optimism, re: usable controls, than I do for Colossus's upcoming remake).

On balance, Extinction looks like a pleasant surprise from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Galaxy">studio best known</a> for ruining <game:Batman: Arkham Knight> on PC.  Let's see how they fare with an original production.
