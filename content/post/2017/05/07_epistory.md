[Epistory](game:Epistory: Typing Chronicles) <i>has</i> a story, told gradually as you explore the world, initally mysterious and progressively steeped in metaphors.  This didn't really do anything for me.

What I did like is that it's a game about typing that <i>isn't totally stupid</i>.  As opposed to [some](game:Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey) [games](game:Words for Evil) which feel more dictated by random letter selection than by real spelling or typing ability, Epistory is an evolution of a "teaches typing" game that actually revolves around and tests your typing skill.

Occasionally, there are bugs that interfere with typing, which is pretty infuriating.  And sometimes exploring the world, looking for the next thing to do, can be tedious.  But the majority of the time, Epistory asks you to type quickly and strategically -- and accomplishing its trials feels genuinely satisfying.

Perhaps the most brilliant part of Epistory is its "adaptive difficulty."  (At least, as far as I could tell.)  I consider myself to be a fairly good typist, and the game had no problem providing me with adequate challenges; a few of its later encounters even took me a few tries to overcome.

Epistory's enchanting graphical style is also worth calling out.  Watching virtual paper fold itself into terrain and features is a visual delight.

Although Epistory ultimately doesn't have that much going for it - it's a pretty-looking typing game - it's extremely well-executed, and one of very few games that allows you to brag about your words-per-minute score.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey>, <game:The Typing of the Dead: Overkill>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: if Letter Quest was less dice-roll-driven, or if there was a not-on-rails Typing of the Dead alternative.  
<b>Arguably competitive with</b>: furiously typing out a caffeine-powered document
