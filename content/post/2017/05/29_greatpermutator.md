{{% game "Great Permutator" %}}Great Permutator{{% /game %}} takes its titular descriptor seriously; more seriously than I'd expected it to.  While on its face, the game looks like a 2D version of assembly-line puzzler {{% game "Infinifactory" %}}Infinifactory{{% /game %}}, Permutator's puzzle mechanics are actually quite different.

The goal in each level is to re-order the input blocks.  That's it.

There are two things that make this difficult:

* The conveyor belts can't cross each other, so moving inputs across the floor requires the precise arrangement of special permutating devices.
* And timing is important, but timing can only be affected by shortening or lengthening the conveyor belts between devices.

Frankly, these challenges aren't fun to me.  Limited mechanics can make for a fun game - {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}} is proof of that - but these mechanics are <i>so</i> limited, that I can't muster the interest to work through them.

It doesn't help that the game looks not just basic, but <i>dull</i>.  It doesn't feel like there's any visual payoff for solving a puzzle.

For someone who can remain engaged with it, Great Permutator offers a lot of puzzles to solve.  And, hey, they're even pretty challenging.  I just don't care enough to spend time with it.

<i>But wait</i> -- I have to correct what I said about "limited" mechanics.  From some internet research, I can see that later levels include devices like block duplicators and color analyzers.  Those sound fun!  Why can't I play with those?

Unfortunately, Great Permutator doesn't allow me to skip ahead by more than three levels.  And there are a whole lot of limited puzzles to suffer through before those fun parts come into play.

<i>Progress: Finished 7 levels.</i>
