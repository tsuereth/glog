More than it did [back in 2010](%site.BaseURL%2010/07/18/darksiders-6/), the combat in <game:Darksiders: Warmastered Edition> is really boring me.

Maybe this will become less of a problem once I accumulate more combat abilities; or maybe I'll become more distracted from it once I reach some real dungeon puzzles.  But this dishwater-dull button-mashing makes a poor first(-ish) impression.
