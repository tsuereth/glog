<game:Uncharted: The Lost Legacy> isn't all that good at telling its story.

Really good adventure stories have a way of sweeping you up and into them; typically, by starting with a small, easily-digestible quest which gradually reveals itself as something bigger and more grandiose.  Indiana Jones does it, James Bond does it, and the previous Uncharted games did it, to great effect.

In The Lost Legacy, it takes about twenty minutes for Chloe to tell you what she's after - the Tusk of Ganesha - and the obligatory treasure-hunt-rival-slash-evil-warlord is right there from the beginning.  So far, there are no twists or surprises to speak of.

Meanwhile, this game's character development is pretty pale compared to its forebears; as is easy for side-stories and prequels (<i>Star Wars</i>), it seems to have fallen into the "static backstory" trap.  Throwaway lines about how Chloe learned archaeology, or past dealings with Nathan Drake, or <i>especially</i> reiterating the same history that Nadine got in [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), don't make these characters feel interesting.

On the flip-side, though, Lost Legacy shows how far Naughty Dog has come at designing compelling levels and gameplay mechanics.  Parkouring through a city is as great as always, but the real showpiece is in the Western Ghats: a sizeable, free-roaming area whose multiple objectives, serene vistas, tall grass (for sneaking!), and organic-feeling enemy encounters are highly reminiscent of [Breath of the Wild](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild).

Throw in a neat little lock-picking mechanic, for peeking in enemy weapon crates - and higher-than-normal puzzle density, including one of the best I can remember from any Uncharted game - and Lost Legacy really starts to look like a proof for the concepts Naughty Dog will build in its next, presumably open-world, franchise.

There's still time for Lost Legacy to improve its storytelling chops, which I hope it does, but in the meantime its gameplay is certainly impressing me.
