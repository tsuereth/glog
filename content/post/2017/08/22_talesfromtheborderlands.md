{{% game "Tales from the Borderlands" %}}Tales from the Borderlands{{% /game %}} isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good.  A couple plot threads didn't have very satisfying resolutions (although most of them did); one or two interactive sequences felt needlessly frustrating; and it's always a shame that Telltale's tech isn't better than it is.

But Tales is a thrilling, funny jaunt through an interesting world with compelling characters.  I think it's about as good as a story-based adventure game can get.  (It's really cool to see that Borderlands' brand of silly adventure story is still entertaining without gunplay and loot-collection.)

The worst that can be said about Tales is that its madcap sense of humor is <i>only</i> as good as {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}'s -- which, to be clear, is a compliment.  And, arguably, that its new characters aren't quite as "charming" as {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" %}}Mr. Torgue{{% /game %}} or {{% game "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep" %}}Tiny Tina{{% /game %}}.

And I'm not sure if it's because the dialog was predictable, or because my own personality is such a product of irreverent videogame culture, but the dialog choices in Tales almost never frustrated me like this kind of game tends to; I always felt like at least one choice reflected what I, the player, really wanted to say.

I'm still not completely sold on Telltale adventures, but this one is definitely a "win" for them.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "The Wolf Among Us" %}}The Wolf Among Us{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}  
<b>In fact</b>: I'm looking forward to a replay trip through Borderlands 2, as soon as I've got the time for it.
