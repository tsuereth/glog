The minutes-long, excruciatingly-boring intro movie is <i>not</i> my biggest concern about {{% game "Shiftlings" %}}Shiftlings{{% /game %}} so far.  That honor goes to the fact that my second player and I completely failed to get local co-op to work.

Our experience was just as <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/310810/discussions/0/154645539343752725/">this poster describes</a>, where the game's functions seemed to become <i>split</i> between two controllers.  (It reminded me of my controller issues with {{% game "Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed" %}}Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed{{% /game %}}, which is <i>not</i> good company to be in.)

Local co-op was the whole reason I bought Shiftlings, so I was prepared to write it off completely until I found <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/310810/discussions/0/350540973990108196/?ctp=2#c350540974015051573">this post</a> claiming that it "works," but is terribly messaged by the UI.

<blockquote>After calibrating once, both controllers work in-game. Note that only the first controller works in the main menu, though, which arguably can be confusing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There should be a text in the top-right corner of the screen saying something like "join the game by pressing Return or Start on second controller". It disappears fairly quick, though, so it I guess it's easy to miss.</blockquote>

I'm willing to give it another try, but this bullshit has already soured my opinion of Shiftlings significantly.
