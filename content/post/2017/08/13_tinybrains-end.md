Well, we're done with <game:Tiny Brains>.  Total running time was about two hours.

I guess the campaign is short enough to run through repeatedly, maybe even as a party game, but I'm not especially anxious to revisit these glitchy physics.

(And in retrospect, I am pretty sure that some puzzles are actually impossible if you're playing by yourself.)

There are a handful of tricky brain-teasers in here, and the game thankfully doesn't overstay its welcome.  But neither does it ever really <i>impress</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:HeartZ: Co-Hope Puzzles>, <game:Kalimba>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Pitfall Planet>, <game:Trine Enchanted Edition>  
<b>Best not to bring this game up</b>: to PETA, what with all the laboratory animal testing.

<i>Progress: Finished the campaign with two players.</i>
