Although the level-select screen makes me appear within striking distance of <game:Infinifactory>'s end (for real, [this time]($SiteBaseURL$2017/06/25/dont-know-why-i-assumed-it-would-be-so-finite/)), the levels themselves paint a different picture.  Like the puzzles that closed the game's first half, these final levels are <i>work</i>.

I've still been enjoying my time working through them, but ... each one takes an evening, now, or even <i>multiple</i> evenings.  These last few puzzles require enough task planning and complexity management to rival software challenges I've actually been paid to work on.

So it may seem weird that I'm taking a "break" by playing <game:Shenzhen I/O>, but relatively speaking, it really does feel quite relaxing.
