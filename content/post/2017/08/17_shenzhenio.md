I'm only "done" with <game:Shenzhen I/O> in the same sense that I'm "done" with <game:TIS-100>.  I've finished the main series of levels, which has unlocked <i>even more</i>, but I don't have the energy or interest to continue on.

While I enjoyed the challenges of mapping high-level functionality to components and code, it remained disappointing, and a little frustrating, that the real difficulty almost always laid in the limits on lines of code and numbers of ports.  And, particularly in that low-level respect, I never felt like Shenzhen asked for as much creative problem solving as TIS did.

Shenzhen I/O helped scratch my unending Zachtronics itch, but wasn't really as satisfying as its sibling games.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Human Resource Machine>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:TIS-100>  
<b>I still seriously hate</b>: this bullshit solitaire game.

<i>Progress: Finished the main campaign.</i>
