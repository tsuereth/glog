Compared to {{% game "Infinifactory" %}}Infinifactory{{% /game %}} and {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}}, I am <i>blazing</i> through {{% game "Shenzhen I/O" %}}Shenzhen I/O{{% /game %}}.  Less because I'm compelled by the fun, and more because I'm already familiar with its challenges.

Since I {{% abslink href="2017/07/24/made-in-china/" %}}last wrote{{% /abslink %}} about Shenzhen, the puzzles have become more nuanced and elaborate; the premise of each one is intriguing, as are the narratively-appropriate components and peripherals.  Thematically, these puzzles do a great job of building on TIS's image-plotting puzzles, by making the output values feel meaningful and <i>cool</i>.

However, these unique twists almost never factor into what makes the puzzles difficult.  And what <i>does</i> make them difficult is disappointingly familiar: limited instruction space, and occasionally, limited input/output ports.

Yup -- the exact same things that stymied me in TIS-100.  It's still entertaining, but ... not as satisfying as new challenges would be.

I've also got mixed feelings about Shenzhen's faux-desktop interface, which is Zachtronics's most visually-appealing UI yet, but is click-heavy and obtuse to actually use.  And the email-based storyline, which sometimes feels like it's subtly building up to something, but is <i>so</i> subtle that I wonder if I'm just imagining it.

I'm having enough fun with the puzzles to keep going, but it certainly feels like the weakest Zachtronics release so far.
