[Apollo Justice: Asinine Attorney](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Apollo Justice - Asinine Attorney) is slightly more ambitious than its [Phoenix Wright](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Phoenix Wright - Asinine Attorney) counterpart, as it recycles art not only from [Spirit of Justice](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice), but <i>also</i> from [Dual Destinies](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies).

Otherwise, it's equally brief, equally silly, and equally un-funny.
