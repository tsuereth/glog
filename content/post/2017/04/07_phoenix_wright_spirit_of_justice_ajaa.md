{{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice - Apollo Justice: Asinine Attorney" %}}Apollo Justice: Asinine Attorney{{% /game %}} is slightly more ambitious than its {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice - Phoenix Wright: Asinine Attorney" %}}Phoenix Wright{{% /game %}} counterpart, as it recycles art not only from {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice" %}}Spirit of Justice{{% /game %}}, but <i>also</i> from {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies" %}}Dual Destinies{{% /game %}}.

Otherwise, it's equally brief, equally silly, and equally un-funny.
