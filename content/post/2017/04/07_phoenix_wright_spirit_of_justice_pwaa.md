{{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Phoenix Wright - Asinine Attorney" %}}Phoenix Wright: Asinine Attorney{{% /game %}} is <i>not</i> the real "Special Episode" DLC for {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice" %}}Spirit of Justice{{% /game %}}.  But it <i>does</i> cost $3.99 (and is bundled with a 3DS home menu theme).

It's terribly stupid.  It's of a subpar quality even by fan-fiction standards.  It's short -- 30 minutes, tops.  It isn't even funny.

You can find much better, and more substantive!, additional cases <a href="http://aceattorney.sparklin.org/">for free, online</a>.

If this episode had been included with the game, I would at least be able to write it off as a gimmicky extra.  But as paid DLC, I expect something way, way better than this garbage.  As it is, I feel like I was tricked into buying the 3DS theme, and this episode just came along for the ride.

Do not buy this.  (Unless you want the 3DS theme.)
