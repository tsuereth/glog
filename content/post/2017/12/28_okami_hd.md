It's <i>kind-of</i> amazing just how up-to-date <game:Ōkami HD> feels, despite the original game's age.  It still has some flaws, but is nevertheless distinctly refreshing.

Going back to what I [wrote about it on PS2](game:Ōkami):

> [...] intricately woven into the fabric of ancient tales. This manner of storytelling, combined with the game's infamous and extremely distinctive aesthetics, make for a really unique experience.

> The Celestial Brush is a really cool gameplay mechanic - but controlling it is still a pain.

> [...] a <b>very</b> big part of the game (I don't hesitate to say a majority of it) is in "optional" content.
> 
> This seems like an intentional choice on the part of the game's director to give the player a godlike feeling: you've got to take care of the little things, too.

> [...] while combat and dungeon play isn't nearly as good as an actual Zelda, there is a lot of fun to be had in Ōkami.

A decade later, this is still how I'd sum the game up: the narrative and aesthetics are unique and breathtaking, the brush controls are fairly imperfect, the optional activities make the world feel alive, and the combat and puzzles are a little on the <i>meh</i> side.

And most of the time, the strengths more than make up for the shortcomings.  It's all just so <i>charming</i>, from the beautiful art style to Issun's irreverent attitude.
