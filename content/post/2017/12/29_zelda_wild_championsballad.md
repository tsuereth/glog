When [Champions' Ballad](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - The Champions' Ballad) was released earlier this month, I downloaded and tried it (on [Wii U](platform:WiiU)) almost immediately.  And abruptly ran into a small, but critical flaw in this DLC: it came out about six months too late.

[Breath of the Wild](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) was a dense, complicated game with lots of mastery to build.  And I hadn't played it since <i>March</i>.  So to call my aptitude "rusty" would be an understatement.

Champions' Ballad <i>starts</i> with a series of challenges using a new weapon, the One-Hit Obliterator.  While wielding it, Link will die in a single hit.

There's just no fucking way that I can pull this off.

I'd need to sink significant time back into rebuilding my atrophied Zelda muscles, before I'd be comfortable tackling the challenges in this DLC.  And there seems to be <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild---the-champions-ballad">some critical consensus</a> that the rewards here, on their own, wouldn't really be worth that much effort.

I'm actually more inclined to start over from scratch, and attempt the Champions' Ballad challenges more organically as part of Breath of the Wild's vast world of content.  I'd been planning on - eventually - doing a fresh playthrough on <platform:Switch>, anyway.

Which is a roundabout way of saying: so long, Wii U.  It's been nice knowing you.
