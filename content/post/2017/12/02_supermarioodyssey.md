Counting <game:Super Mario Odyssey>'s power moons is a little complicated.  For one thing, some of the collectible moons are actually <i>triple moons</i> that increment the counter on your spaceship by 3; but they still only count as one in the list of collectibles.

For another thing, you can use gold coins to <i>buy</i> an infinite amount of moons.  So... huh.

At any rate, there are 836 collectible moons - not counting triples! - and I got 816 of them.  The majority of those, I even got without help from the interweb!  And the game was really most fun when I was just wandering around a kingdom, looking for things I'd missed.

The 20 moons I've got left are from challenges that I'm deeming <i>too fucking hard</i>, like footraces that require mastery of difficult shortcut-enabling jumps, or <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/super-mario-odyssey/Darker_Side">the final level that doesn't have any checkpoints</a>.

And I collected all the purple coins for special outfits, which really seems like the most important in-game accomplishment.

Yeah.  Mario Odyssey is pretty awesome.
