In 2014, when I <a href="https://tsuereth.com/glog/2014/06/29/im-just-gonna-stick-with-the-cartoon-from-now-on/">wrote</a> that [Finn and Jake's Epic Quest](game:Adventure Time: Finn and Jake's Epic Quest) had "pretty much annihilated" my hopes for an open-world, wacky-zany Adventure Time game -- <a href="https://www.outrightgames.com/adventure-time-pirates-of-the-enchiridion/">this</a> is kind of what I was talking about.

At least, the info teased so far for Pirates of the Enchiridion sounds like just the thing I want.  It isn't being made by WayForward.  It's "An original Adventure Time story, all voiced by the showâ€™s cast."  It has <i>pirates</i>.  BMO is <i>playable</i>?

Dare I get my hopes up?  ... especially considering the publisher's <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/ben-10">less-than-stellar record</a>?
