I've been telling myself since [August]($SiteBaseURL$2017/08/06/working-overtime/) that I would, eventually, come back and wrap up <game:Infinifactory>.  But every time I actually think about it, I <i>just can't even</i> imagine myself enjoying the hours of work it'll take to do the five puzzles I have remaining.

At least of the puzzles currently available to me, they all require assembly from such a low level - like making a LEGO set out of only two-stud bricks - that the excitement of pulling off ingenious engineering becomes overshadowed by grueling tedium.

I would have to call these last few levels an unfortunate misstep for Infinifactory, and the culmination of an awkward pace (with multiple difficulty spikes) throughout the game.

But despite that, I have to commend Infinifactory on the whole, for delivering an impressive amount of great puzzle content.  Not all of its puzzles are winners, but ... a great many of them are.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Shenzhen I/O> and <game:TIS-100> for sure; and probably <game:SpaceChem>, in general.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:SpaceChem> had a better difficulty curve (although its final boss was kind of terrible bullshit, too).  
<b>Just in time</b>: for <game:Opus Magnum>! (hopefully coming out of Early Access <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/558990/announcements/detail/1465222576769789696">soon?</a>)
