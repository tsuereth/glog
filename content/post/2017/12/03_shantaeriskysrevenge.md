Immediately, the most jarring thing about <game:Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut> is the high-definition UI art that it's putting on top of [Nintendo DS](platform:NDS)-era gameplay graphics.  (Honestly, they look even more like <platform:GBA> graphics.)  The modern-ish HD veneer fades away pretty quickly.

And beneath that veneer is a game that feels just a bit too antiquated for today.  The controls aren't quite responsive enough; the hitboxes are never exactly what I expect; the menu sucks (where's my Map button); the UI's visual language is unclear; combat isn't interesting at all; the logic on enemy respawning is all over the place.

It's slightly bizarre that, although I definitely wouldn't call the game <i>hard</i>, I end up taking a fair amount of damage -- because I'm having a lot of trouble timing my attacks and movement correctly.  Thankfully Shantae's HP is more than enough to accommodate this.

Gameplay aside, Shantae's world feels very minimally charming.  Pixel-art belly-dancing can only go so far.

... actually, I guess my nitpicks don't necessarily indicate "antiquated" as much as they might "sloppy."  A trend I really can't help but ascribe to <tag:WayForward>, [game](game:Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!) after [game](game:Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know!) after [game](game:Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition).
