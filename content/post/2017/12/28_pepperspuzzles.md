{{% game "Pepper's Puzzles" %}}Pepper's Puzzles{{% /game %}} is a humble little picross game, perhaps even humbler than {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}}.  It pays some welcome attention toward subtle quality-of-life features, like a randomized soundtrack and a "dynamic background" to prevent the brain equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in">burn-in</a>.

It's also got a very-slightly quirky sense of humor, which is neat.

But what really attracted to me to Pepper's Puzzles, over some other picross games currently on Super-Steam-Sale, is its "200+" puzzles.

The Mosaic mode (like other picross games' assemble-a-bigger-picture puzzles), and the surprisingly-stressful Time Trial challenges, are nifty distractions.  But I've bet on Pepper to give me plenty of hours of picture-puzzle solving, and it's looking pretty good so far.
