Like I said [back in 2013]($SiteBaseURL$2013/01/30/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt-2/):

<blockquote>... following Sir Hammerlock into the untamed wilds to track and kill fantastic beasts, should be a blast. But this only happens in optional quests, and only a couple of times. [...] Dr. Nakayama [is] a truly (and self-admittedly) pathetic villain who, at the end, is actually terrified to fight you.</blockquote>

With its exceptionally-brief critical path, underwhelming final boss, sprawling and poorly-designed maps, and outright annoying enemies (the persistently-respawning giant spores!, the miniscule-weakpoint scaylions!, the face-armored savages, and their auto-healing witch doctors!), [Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt](game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt) is <i>undoubtedly</i> the weakest of <game:Borderlands 2>'s story DLCs.

[Mr. Torgue's campaign](game:Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage) wasn't exceptionally creative, but it at least met the bar of the main game's "average" content.  Hammerlock's campaign doesn't.

It's just not very good.

<b>Better than</b>: maybe <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage>, or even [Enter the Dominatrix](game:Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix), which was like the worst Saints Row DLC.  
<b>But there's a light at the end of this tunnel</b>: and it's [a critical hit!](game:Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep)

<i>Progress: Bunch of sidequests left to do.</i>
