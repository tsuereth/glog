Like I said {{% abslink href="2013/01/30/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt-2/" %}}back in 2013{{% /abslink %}}:

<blockquote>... following Sir Hammerlock into the untamed wilds to track and kill fantastic beasts, should be a blast. But this only happens in optional quests, and only a couple of times. [...] Dr. Nakayama [is] a truly (and self-admittedly) pathetic villain who, at the end, is actually terrified to fight you.</blockquote>

With its exceptionally-brief critical path, underwhelming final boss, sprawling and poorly-designed maps, and outright annoying enemies (the persistently-respawning giant spores!, the miniscule-weakpoint scaylions!, the face-armored savages, and their auto-healing witch doctors!), {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt" %}}Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt{{% /game %}} is <i>undoubtedly</i> the weakest of {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}'s story DLCs.

{{% game "Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" %}}Mr. Torgue's campaign{{% /game %}} wasn't exceptionally creative, but it at least met the bar of the main game's "average" content.  Hammerlock's campaign doesn't.

It's just not very good.

<b>Better than</b>: maybe {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" %}}Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage{{% /game %}}, or even {{% game "Saints Row IV - Enter the Dominatrix" %}}Enter the Dominatrix{{% /game %}}, which was like the worst Saints Row DLC.  
<b>But there's a light at the end of this tunnel</b>: and it's {{% game "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep" %}}a critical hit!{{% /game %}}

<i>Progress: Bunch of sidequests left to do.</i>
