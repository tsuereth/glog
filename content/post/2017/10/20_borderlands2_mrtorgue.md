In short, {{% game "Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" %}}Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage{{% /game %}} would be a firm "meh" if not for Mr. Torgue himself.

Where {{% game "Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty" %}}Captain Scarlett{{% /game %}} offered "more of the same" {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}-style content, Mr. Torgue offers less.  The whole campaign smacks heavily of asset reuse, from overly-familiar landscapes (brown!) and enemies (bandits!), to quests that revisit an area multiple times, to sidequests that simply ask you to repeat a task but "harder."

Gameplay-wise, the only thing that Mr. Torgue really excels at is churning-out high-level quests.  But they're no more creative or interesting than the repetitive wave-after-wave-of-bandits arenas from the main game.

What makes this DLC remarkable is purely down to the character of Mr. Torgue.  He is the best.

And his running commentary throughout the campaign makes it worth playing.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII" %}}Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty" %}}Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty{{% /game %}}  
<b>...but Mr. Torgue</b>: is still my favorite character.

<i>Progress: Finished the campaign, some sidequests.</i>
