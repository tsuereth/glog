Despite missing a couple of modern creature-comforts, like selecting multiple objectives or fast-traveling from anywhere, <game:Borderlands 2> still holds up really, really well.

As long as you can get past the boring starting zones.

And assuming you have at least one friend to play with.  (Alone, I think it might get more dull, and frustrating.)

The crazy world design, the humorous dialog, and the allure of random, awesome loot all pull together into a silly, yet <i>substantial</i> game.  And there's so much content!  The enemy variety, amount of quests, different ability and gun modifiers... are all just bonkers.

It's going to be hard to temper expectations for the next game.  Gearbox has a lot to measure up to.

... oh yeah, I guess I should get around to [the Pre-Sequel](game:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel), at some point.  Maybe once we're done with this game's DLCs.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: for local multiplayer/co-op? maybe nothing.  
<b>Avast</b>: time to [plunder some booty](game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty)!

<i>Progress: Finished almost all the base game's quests, except the arena challenges and Terramorphous.</i>
