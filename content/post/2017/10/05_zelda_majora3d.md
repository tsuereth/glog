Toward the end, playing through {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D" %}}Majora's Mask 3D{{% /game %}} felt like I was just going through the motions.  And sure, I didn't <i>need</i> to check all the checkboxes and collect all the collectibles, but ... well, I'll get to that in a minute.

It's especially evident in the shadow of {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" %}}Breath of the Wild{{% /game %}}, but Majora's Mask feels more like a <i>precursor</i> to open-world design, than like a real sandbox.  It's not really "open" in the current sense of the term; it's more like a sequence of, do the first dungeon, then some things that unlock after that, then the second dungeon, then some things after that, <i>et cetera</i>.

Both the main storyline, and the bulk of the game's sidequests, are gated by a fairly static sequence of items.  You can't roam the world and do whatever activities you find; first you have to climb the equipment ladder.  And that means doing the dungeons, and events around the dungeons, in an enforced order.

But it isn't just the lock-step sequence of dungeons and sidequests that makes Majora's Mask feel so antiquated.  Many sidequests - and even some errands necessary for the main story - are time-sensitive within Termina's three-day span.  If you happen to have the necessary items, at the right place, but <i>not at the right time</i>, you might never know that there's an event there at all.

Like going back to {{% game "Metroid" %}}Metroid{{% /game %}} and finding that there was no in-game map, the lack of discoverability (even with new hints!) around Termina's various events is a humbling, surprising disappointment.

But if you decided not to care about optional events and sidequests - i.e. if you were only to progress through the main quest - you'd find that there isn't much <i>to</i> Majora's Mask.  There are only four dungeons, all of them fairly brief (though two of them are pretty creative).  And the critical-path content between dungeons tends to be laborious, like {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" %}}Skyward Sword{{% /game %}}'s tedium but without that game's explicit guidance.

Majora's Mask 3D is a commendable upgrade from the N64 original, both in its graphics and its user-friendliness -- the save system and time controls are way better, now.  But the things that made Majora's Mask so memorable for me - the richly complex sidequests - are brought low by the game's now-archaic world design.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Darksiders Warmastered Edition" %}}Darksiders Warmastered Edition{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" %}}The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D{{% /game %}}  
<b>Hard to say</b>: how it compares to {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" %}}Skyward Sword{{% /game %}}, which I'm not interested in playing again.
