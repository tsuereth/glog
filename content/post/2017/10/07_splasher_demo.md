<game:Splasher> has been on my radar for a while, but only recently got a demo.

It's not quite as much like <game:Portal 2> or <game:Super Mario Sunshine> as I expected -- that is, the special paint effects, and cleaning them, are not <i>the biggest</i> part of the game.  They're still big!  But, as it turns out, the real focus of Splasher is on skillful platforming.

This is something I've historically been not-that-great at; so I'm a little apprehensive about how difficult it might become in later levels.  But I'm still pretty interested, due to the platforming nuances introduced by paint.

Based on the demo, I wouldn't hesitate at all to call Splasher a "more fun" version of [Dustforce](game:Dustforce DX) or <game:Super Meat Boy>.

I hope I can put up with all the dying I'll do in Splasher, because it seems pretty fun so far.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
