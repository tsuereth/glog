I've been percolating these changes for a while, and finally pulled the trigger: Glog pages for a specific game will now include relevant tags.

These tags are pulled (in an offline process) from <a href="https://www.igdb.com">IGDB.com</a>, and cross-referenced automatically by <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> when the Glog is rebuilt.

So with minimal maintenance, I can collate, say, all {{% tag "Puzzle" %}}Puzzle games{{% /tag %}} or games in {{% tag "Borderlands" %}}the Borderlands franchise{{% /tag %}}.

I'm pretty excited about this -- if only because it'll make it easier for me to find comparable games when filling out my "Better than" and "Not as good as" lines.
