{{% game "Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty" %}}Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty{{% /game %}} is essentially more-of-the-same for the {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}} player, and that's pretty great.

My only real point against it is that there isn't all that much content.  Not that it's "short," but in the shadow of the main game's overflowing glut of side-missions, it's just "not long."

... and it's somewhat disappointing that - for the industry at large - this still feels very true.  Captain Scarlett remains a stand-out example of DLC done right.
