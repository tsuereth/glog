<i>Considering</i> that <game:Cat Quest> is a mobile game, it offers quite a lot of content: multiple hours of simplified hack-and-slash gameplay, treasure chests with adorable loot, dozens of quests, and a metric buttload of cat puns.

The story gets a bit groan-worthy toward the end.  But that wasn't the reason I was playing this game, anyway.  I played it for the cat puns.

So many cat puns.

It's refreshing that Cat Quest doesn't have any in-app purchases or other trite monetization bullshit.  (Although there is a quest that explicitly references another game, which itself is ad-supported.)  It's a game that you buy and then play.

For what it is, Cat Quest is a satisfying - and sometimes even challenging - action RPG.  Although your mileage may vary based on your investment in cat puns.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Swords & Soldiers>, <game:Uncharted: Fortune Hunter> (in other words: the few other mobile action games I've played)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Child of Light>, <game:Ittle Dew> (in other words: a deeper RPG)  
<b>The game hints at a sequel or expansion, with dogs</b>: I hope it's a <i>good boy</i>.

<i>Progress: Level 100, completed all the things</i>
