I've tried, and failed, to really sink into {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D" %}}Majora's Mask 3D{{% /game %}} multiple times over the past two and a half years.  I think it's fair to say that the game's opening hasn't aged very well:

* Narratively, it's <i>weird</i> and fairly un-charming;
* Before you've picked up some key items (like the bow), it's extremely linear;
* And the main quest sometimes stumbles over obtuse "adventure game logic" scenarios.

... but once I finally powered myself through the first few in-game days, these issues began to clear up.  The plot's disparate elements feel more relevant as you free each Guardian giant, and the game's sidequest-heavy design comes to the fore once the map actually opens up.

As for that last bit; well, there's an in-game hint system, now.

Majora's Mask doesn't really command the same regard that it did back in 2000, especially in light of {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" %}}Breath of the Wild{{% /game %}}'s fresh and powerful take on an open Zelda world.  But the adventure is still fun.

And, more than anything else, I'm looking forward to filling up my Bomber's Notebook again.
