Five years later, <game:Borderlands 2> still works pretty well.  It's a bit slow to start - with Claptrap leading you around by the nose, weapons that feel relatively <i>sane</i>, and not many sidequests - but Pandora's bizarre, deadly personality is enough to keep things interesting until all of that starts to pick up.

It helps that the art style suits the game so well; it still looks good enough to be considered a modern game.  With the possible exception of Unreal 3's trademark blurry-until-loaded textures.

Even as a Siren - last time, I was an Assassin - a sniper rifle still seems like the best option, since short-range combat is so dangerous.  But, hey, if I have to explode bad guys' heads from a distance -- so be it.
