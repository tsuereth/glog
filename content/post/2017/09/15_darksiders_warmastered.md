When <game:Darksiders> was more recent, it compared fairly well to [Twilight Princess](game:The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii)) -- and favorably, even, to [Skyward Sword](game:The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword).

But games have moved on, and <i>even Zelda</i> [has moved on](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild), in the years since.

And so while <game:Darksiders: Warmastered Edition> is certainly an admirable graphical improvement over the original, the gameplay mechanics have aged poorly.  I'm no more excited about hacking through dozens of garbage enemies today than I was in 2010.

Progress feels slow.  The game world isn't that interesting.  Combat is repetitive.  I'd wanted to get to the horse, at least, but that's still several hours away -- and I just can't muster the interest for it.

If you loved the previous game, there's no reason not to love this remaster; the visual upgrade is pretty great.  But for me, this iteration only highlights the original game's shortcomings.
