I can't even remember how I ended up with <game:Zoo Rampage>.  It must have been part of a bundle I bought months, or maybe years ago.  But as long as I was going to boot it up for Steam trading cards, I figured I'd see what the game was actually like.

You pick an animal, and you wreck the shit out of a zoo.  Like, beating up tourists, plowing through gates, demolishing food stands, knocking over portable toilets.

It's shallow as hell: the differences between animals are minimal (speed, and maybe attack range?).  And the only goal is to accumulate enough "points" (think dollars worth of damage, like in <game:Blast Corps>) to unlock the next stage, of which there are only a few.

It's very stupid, and I absolutely wouldn't buy it intentionally.  But considering I had no expectations of it, Zoo Rampage was ... better than I expected.

<i>Progress: Finished the fish-collecting stage.</i>
