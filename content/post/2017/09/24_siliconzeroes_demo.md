<game:Silicon Zeroes>, in the same vein as <game:Human Resource Machine>, is like a Zachtronics programming metaphor that's pretty thin on the "metaphor."  It's set in 1960s Silicon Valley.  You use adders and memory to perform math and logic.  It's pretty straightforward.

The facade that distinguishes it from straight-up programming is that you develop algorithms using a visual node graph -- similar to how <game:Shenzhen I/O> visualized connecting inputs and outputs.  (Except that Silicon Zeroes doesn't make you micromanage the connection lines.)

It's got a charming aesthetic, and there are optimization goals for each puzzle.

What more is there to say?  Of course I'm going to buy and play this, someday.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
