<game:Hexcells Infinite> is the final form of <game:Hexcells>.  It still doesn't <i>look</i> all that great, but it has puzzles just as challenging as those in <game:Hexcells Plus>, as well as an "infinite" mode (randomly generated puzzles that, well, aren't all that hard, but provide even more puzzles if you should feel the need for those).

<i>Most importantly</i>, it finally saves puzzle progress when you exit to the menu, <i>and it has Steam cloud saves</i>.

Finally!

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Hexcells Plus>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Paint it Back>  
<b>Thanks for the "infinite" puzzles</b>: but after doing the hundred or so from all three games, I think I'm all set, thanks.
