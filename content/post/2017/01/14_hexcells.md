I had a much easier time accepting <game:Hexcells>'s puzzle conceits than <game:SquareCells>'s -- probably because it didn't look like [picross](game:Picross DS).  (Yeah, not a great reason, but here we are.)

Like its squarer follow-up, Hexcells feels very much like an amateur game.  The formatting of puzzle clues looks like it was made up on the spot; going back to the menu resets a puzzle in progress; and <i>there's no Steam cloud saving</i>, which is baffling, right?  This game was put on Steam in 2014, well after the point I'd expect any new game to have cloud saves.

But, at least for me, the puzzle mechanics felt more cohesive this time around.  I didn't feel frustrated with a puzzle's lack of apparent information; I felt just intrigued enough to actually figure it out.

Of course the puzzles in Hexcells also don't get very hard.  That, apparently, is what <game:Hexcells Plus> is for.
