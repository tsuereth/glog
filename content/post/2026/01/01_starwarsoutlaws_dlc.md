<game:Star Wars Outlaws> struggled to tell an engaging story, but succeeded at constructing believable, immersive worlds to explore. Its DLC packs [Wild Card](game:Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card) and [A Pirate's Fortune](game:Star Wars Outlaws: A Pirate's Fortune) add some pretty memorable locations of their own -- and take advantage of their narrower scopes to tell some slightly more compelling stories.

Wild Card sees Kay getting mixed up in yet another back-room power struggle, forced to run an errand for a corrupt Imperial governor ... *on a gambling starliner*. You'll uncover the clandestine ship that's running a high-stakes sabacc tournament, don a flashy outfit and infiltrate its guest list, then bluff (and cheat) with Lando to heist the tournament's macguffin prize.

The part after the sabacc game, where you need to follow Lando and the governor back to his base and do more typical sneak-and-shoot stuff, falls a little flat by comparison. But the Wild Card story overall is still very slick and *cool*.

Then there's A Pirate's Fortune, which tells a tale of hidden treasure, double-crossing raiders, and - most importantly - [Hondo Ohnaka](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Ohnaka). Chasing down treasure maps and unraveling the mystery of the extinct Khepi civilization (while bantering with and knocking out pirates) is a fun time, too, but it should be no surprise that Hondo himself is the star here.

This DLC also **adds gameplay features**, believe it or not: there are new smuggling mission types with the Miyuki Trade League, and there's even a new starfighter! Though the Refractor can only be flown in the new Khepi system, and the Miyuki contracts don't have much staying power; I completed its new cargo-upgrade path in about an hour. This new stuff is still *neat*, though.

Both Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune add charming, self-contained, narratively interesting missions to the Star Wars Outlaws experience. What I liked about Outlaws was exploring its galaxy and getting lost in its expansive diversions; these DLCs play perfectly into that strength.

**Better than**: <game:Middle-earth: Shadow of War - Blade of Galadriel>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds>  
**I'm just so happy for**: more Hondo! What a scoundrel.
