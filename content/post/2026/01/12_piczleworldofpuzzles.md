<game:Piczle World of Puzzles> shares a name, and some title art, with one of my all-time favorite nonogram hybrid games: <game:Piczle Cross Adventure>. Adventure pulled the delightful trick of combining puzzles with adventure game mechanics, like an open world map, lighthearted storytelling, and faux progression elements (equipment and experience points). World of Puzzles ... doesn't have any of those.

It's just puzzles. Hm.

And (admittedly, like Adventure) the puzzle interface could be better -- clicking and dragging will drift between rows and columns, and there's measurable **lag when the hint numbers update**.

Caveat: the game is currently in Early Access, and the developer's "full version" plan does state *"A separate adventure mode may also be added."*

But as of writing, World of Puzzles's free built-in puzzles don't make a compelling case for buying more.
