<tag:Duck Detective> is back! [The Ghost of Glamping](game:Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping) sees our ~~irresponsible~~ down-on-his-luck hero thrown into a new mystery, along with his budding sidekick Freddy (the nerd from [The Secret Salami](game:Duck Detective: The Secret Salami)).

This new case checks all the same boxes as last time:

- Enchanting dialog and personalities? *Check*.
- Adorable art style? *Check*.
- Good-enough investigation and "deducktion" gameplay? *Check*.
- Short (and sweet)? *Check*.
- Hilarious loading-screen tips? *Big check*.

Ghost of Glamping does present one *slight* improvement upon its predecessor: a map in the menu! ... not that it's all that helpful, the world is still small enough to easily remember its layout.

But it's not like Duck Detective really needed an upgrade; he just needs more cases. More scenes to investigate, more ridiculous characters to meet, more of McQuacklin's self-indulgent melodrama. And that's exactly what Ghost of Glamping delivers.

**Better than**: <game:Duck Detective: The Secret Salami>, if just barely.  
**Not as good as**: <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (NDS)>  
**Fingers and wings crossed**: that we'll see more of the Duck Detective in 2026.
