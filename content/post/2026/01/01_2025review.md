Yeah... kind of a rough year. 2025 wasn't exactly great for the Glog, either.

At a mere 15 games glogged, last year was my **least-active on record**. Yeesh.

I can blame a *little* of that on how much time I spent with a few specific games -- *more than a hundred hours each* in <game:Satisfactory>, <game:Deep Rock Galactic>, and <game:The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered>. That's several hundred hours I couldn't use to play other games, after all.

But, if I'm being real with myself, I think I just didn't muster as much personal energy for gaming in 2025 as I have in past years.

At least what I played was largely new - or new to me - with only one replay last year: <game:Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth>, in its remastered <Ace Attorney Investigations Collection> form, as a lead-in to the [Prosecutor's Gambit](game:Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit) sequel.

My 2025 playthroughs were mostly full-sized, too, with exceptions for the expansion packs <game:God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla> and <game:The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles>.

And ... in retrospect, yes! A good proportion of what I played was pretty <rating:Awesome>.

- <game:God of War Ragnarök>? An epic, awesome adventure through myth and legend and family trauma and world serpents.
- <game:Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit>? An enthralling, awesome story with a memorable cast of charmingly absurd personalities.
- <game:Satisfactory>? An enrapturing, awesome construction mega-project that was surprisingly ... cozy.
- <game:Deep Rock Galactic>? A captivating, awesome time-sink that's *still* keeping me busy on a weekly basis.
- <game:Squeakross: Home Squeak Home>? A comfortable, awesome chunk of brain exercises with bonus photos of adorable pet rats.
- <game:Donkey Kong Bananza>? An exciting, awesome journey through fantastical environments that you can punch the shit out of.

Maybe not such a bad year after all.

Some of my less-than-awesome, <rating:Good> playthroughs were plenty satisfying, too; I'll highlight in particular the snack-sized shooter-vania <game:Minishoot' Adventures>, and the bloated-yet-entertaining <game:Star Wars Outlaws> (whose DLCs I'm still blasting my way through).

There were just a few games that really disappointed me last year: the <rating:Meh> <game:LEGO Horizon Adventures>, which failed to live up to either <tag:Horizon> *or* <tag:LEGO> expectations; the <rating:Bad> <game:Star Wars Jedi: Survivor>, which squandered whatever goodwill and optimism I had left after [Fallen Order](game:Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order); and I sadly couldn't bear <game:Voxelgram 2> enough to qualify a rating, it having *ruined* the iterative puzzle-solving that I loved from [its predecessor](game:Voxelgram).

Alright. So. What's up for 2026?

There were a handful of 2025 releases that I'm *really* looking forward to catching up with, including <game:Clair Obscur: Expedition 33> and <game:Dispatch (2025)>. *Maybe* <game:Hollow Knight: Silksong>, though I'm really hoping they add an easy mode.

Now that the <platform:Switch 2> has DK-punched its way into my living room, I think I owe [Tears of the Kingdom](game:The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition) an upgraded replay. And as a historic <tag:Metroid Prime> fan, I feel almost *obligated* to - eventually - pick up <game:Metroid Prime 4: Beyond>, even if its [reviews are a bit mixed](https://opencritic.com/game/16868/metroid-prime-4-beyond).

And, oh yeah, I never did catch up on [my January plans]($SiteBaseURL$2025/01/01/2024-in-review-ah-shit-here-we-go-again/) for <game:The Talos Principle II: Road to Elysium>, <game:Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty>, [Resident Evil 4's recent remake](game:Resident Evil 4 (2023)), or [Ghost of Tsushima's PC re-release](game:Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut).

My [backlog]($SiteBaseURL$backlog/) sure isn't wanting, these days. Time to get to it.
