Separate Ways was originally a *menu option* (in RE4's [PS2](game:Resident Evil 4) and [Wii](game:Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition) releases). But times have changed; now, DLC exists.

The [Resident Evil 4 remake](game:Resident Evil 4 (2023))'s downloadable [Separate Ways](game:Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways) pack is more than a simple update and cash-grab, though -- this version of Ada's story is expanded, with a meaningful amount of new content and variety.

It doesn't play all *that* differently from the main game, which is a good thing: Ada collects treasure, upgrades her weapons, and blows up infected cultists a lot like Leon did. (Though she starts with an SMG, which is pretty fun.) And in cases where she re-treads familiar ground - like the village, or the hedge maze - Ada's grappling hook (!) makes navigating old areas feel "new" again.

This mini-campaign's story scenes and cinematics don't exactly add depth to the events of RE4; at best, they just tee up Wesker's <game:Resident Evil 5> plot.

But Separate Ways gave me a few more hours of the dumb, exciting adventure that I enjoyed in the main game.

**Better than**: <game:Batman: Arkham Knight - A Matter of Family>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Control: AWE>  
**Also gotta love**: a beautiful [laser hallway](https://www.polygon.com/23891230/resident-evil-4-remake-laser-hallway-separate-ways-dlc/) homage to [the 2002 film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/).
