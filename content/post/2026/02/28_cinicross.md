[Squeakross](game:Squeakross: Home Squeak Home)'s more-free-puzzles updates didn't *just* pull me back into that cozy little rodent house; they *also* [drew my attention to](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2871440/view/494969157373132805) a nonogram-hybrid that I otherwise would've ignored: <game:Cinicross>, a rogue-like dungeon delver with timed puzzle challenges.

The "rogue-like" part is why I would've ignored it  -- 'cause I tend to very rapidly tire of [die-and-retry-based games](game:Rogue Legacy). And after playing Cinicross's demo ... I'm still not into it, but! I'm glad to have given it a shot.

(And glad that more nonogram hybrids are getting out there, in general.)

Losing health points when you take too long to solve a puzzle, that part works pretty well; and the "loot" you collect for power-ups, like randomly revealing squares or safeguarding against mis-clicks - as *weird* as those effects can feel - are interesting little twists on the typical nonogram routine.

But the **severity** of health loss that follows the timer, and the depressingly-low amount of persistent experience points I got after a "run," left me with a sense of dread about the repetitive grinding it could take to make meaningful progress in Cinicross.

At least it's trying something more creative and exciting than <game:Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords>, or <game:PictoQuest: The Cursed Grids>.
