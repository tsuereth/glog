"More free puzzles" is [like a siren's song]($SiteBaseURL$2024/07/28/bigger-and-voxelier/), for me.

Just [six months ago]($SiteBaseURL$2025/08/30/the-squeaky-rat-gets-the-cheese/), I heaped praise upon [Squeakross](game:Squeakross: Home Squeak Home) for delivering 650 nonograms to me in an adorable package. Now they're up to ... **886**!?

And the game's "solid user interface" has [only got better](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2871440/view/530996147414631518), too.

As *blasé* as I still am about the virtual dollhouse and rodent customization, Squeakross is becoming more and more entrenched as one of my favorite puzzle collections.
