Have you ever thought that <tag:Ace Attorney> could use more *magic*? Not like, more spirit channeling and psyche-locks, I mean **fireballs and transmutation and *dragons*** and shit. If so -- have I got good news for you!

<game:Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane> adapts finger-pointing, desk-pounding courtroom drama to a swords-and-sorcery setting. It unabashedly follows in Phoenix Wright's footsteps, from the "speedy trial" premise - immediate arrest, next-day opening statements - to your cross-examination Press and Present options. Tyrion even has a prestigious *badge* he can show off.

Just imagine Athena Cykes using mind-reading magic, rather than Mood Matrix technology, to discover when a suspect is hiding something; or Apollo Justice calling out a witness for alleging he cast "Conjure Light" to see the crime, but previous testimony put him outside the spell's short range! Attorney of the Arcane shows great admiration for the Ace Attorney games (which, hey, I greatly admire them too) and so the *way this game works* feels very familiar.

It's more than just a faithful homage to Capcom's franchise, though: Tyrion Cuthbert's world is his own, as is his story. This game's investigation and courtroom scenes use emotive art and dialog to portray deep, case-spanning themes of class strife and hierarchical conflict -- while also gradually revealing the mythical backstories of Wyverngarde and its cast of characters.

And those characters possess strong, memorable personalities of their own, despite recognizable inspirations. Tyrion has sympathetic moments of self-doubt and helplessness, like Apollo; but is driven by an unstoppable, Edgeworthian determination to make things right. Prosecutor Aria Steelwind's youthful need to prove herself screams "Franziska" at first; but it's not long before her softer side appears, a friendliness and helpfulness akin to Gumshoe or Ema Skye. Companion Celeste is full of Maya-like eager supportiveness, as well as Simon Blackquill-like physical intimidation (and sword-mastery).

Tyrion's crew can also behave a little less ... *family friendly* than Phoenix's gang, which is a lot of fun.

Like the tales of [Japanifornia](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eat-your-hamburgers-apollo) that inspired it, Cuthbert's cases weave multiple threads that ultimately come together in a really satisfying way. The copy editing isn't perfect (heck, [neither was Capcom's]($SiteBaseURL$2007/01/23/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-justice-for-all-4/)), but I'm otherwise extremely impressed by this game's quality and volume of writing.

There *are* facets of Attorney of the Arcane that hold it back. Several evidence puzzles require counter-intuitive solutions (though again, not like Capcom hasn't [stumbled here, too]($SiteBaseURL$2025/02/14/overruled/)), and a whole lot of its Investigation screens are complete wastes of time; I'd rather they'd [remove the button, when unneeded]($SiteBaseURL$2024/04/13/you-cant-change-destiny-but-you-can-remaster-it/).

But what hurts this game the most, I'd say, is its user interface. From unclear or missing controls, to awkward mid-screen scrollbars, to wacky sub-panel detail buttons, ... to scene-investigation text that kicks you *back out* of the investigate screen ... and although Cuthbert can be played with a gamepad, just barely, I had some frustrating moments with its selection and focus handling that dragged down my overall experience.

In narrative terms, though - especially its charming, engaging cast of characters (including a dog! ... and a monkey!) - Tyrion Cuthbert: Attorney of the Arcane feels like it's earned a seat at Ace Attorney's table.

**Better than**: <game:Regeria Hope Episode 1>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit>  
**Oh and!**: [the soundtrack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487580/Tyrion_Cuthbert_Attorney_of_the_Arcane_Soundtrack/) is also thrilling and catchy (and, uh, somewhat reminiscent of Ace Attorney's compositions).
