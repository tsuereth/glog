<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jDTGT.jpg">Well</a>-- actually, what I expected based on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330754003/bear-simulator">campaign</a> was a little joke game with some satirical nods to sandboxes like {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" %}}Skyrim{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Grand Theft Auto V" %}}GTA 5{{% /game %}}.  But that expectation faded once {{% game "Bear Simulator" %}}Bear Simulator{{% /game %}}'s campaign updates indicated that the developer was trying to ... make a real game, I guess.

And the result is, aside from being fairly un-funny, just a poor game in general.  Even disregarding its graphical infidelities (distracting pop-in and jagged terrain, for example), the game's mechanics and stats are poorly explained, and trying to do something as simple as bear-swipe a duck is bafflingly frustrating.

Bear Simulator could have settled for being a mild exploration-based game, at least, but the map's nooks and crannies tend to be unsatisfyingly empty.  I felt like a chump after I scaled a hill and crossed a river using a makeshift log bridge, then found absolutely nothing on the other side.

I don't regret burning a few dollars on the campaign for my own amusement.  But - based on the brief time I spent with it so far - I believe I <i>would</i> regret trying to extract more amusement from the finished product.
