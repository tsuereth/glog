<game:Wolfenstein: The Old Blood> makes short work of the goodwill built by [The New Order](game:Wolfenstein: The New Order).  The latter succeeded as a parcel of entertainment because it wrapped a technically-tight shooter with interesting characters, intriguing settings, and a thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride of level design.  But the former lays said technically-tight shooter bare: This is a Nazi-killin' game, with little else to it.

If Old Blood does anything better than its predecessor, it's putting forth challenging encounters with multiple and/or tough enemies.  And frankly, I don't consider that to the game's benefit.  Heavily-armored bullet-sponge enemies are <i>annoying as shit</i> -- throwing several of them at me at once is not what I consider a fun time.  And when I can mow down dozens of Nazis only to die near-instantaneously to a machine-gun brute hidden in a monster closet; well.  That's even less of a fun time.

But what hurts the most about Old Blood isn't that the shooting is hard, I mean, I would be more than willing to put up with that if the game scenario was as engaging as New Order.  But it isn't.  I have no motivation to go on in this game -- there isn't any grand narrative payoff to defeating a room full of crazy enemies.  There are only more crazy enemies.

This might be pretty great for someone who was super into the older Wolfenstein games.  But for me, it's a solid "meh," benefiting only from the fact that it's still a technically-tight shooter.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Sniper: Ghost Warrior>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Wolfenstein: The New Order>  
<b>And yeah</b>: I know that I'm most of the way through the game, already.  I feel like an idiot for wasting as many hours on it as I did.

<i>Progress: Gave up in Chapter 6 - Ruins.</i>
