At first, <game:Ink> reminded me a lot of <game:VVVVVV>, for its lack of hesitation in killing you rapidly and frequently.  Actually, that's kind of the point; Ink reveals the level layout with paint splatter when you die.  Pretty fun!

When the levels started to get more lengthy and involved, I became more nervous about my ability to tolerate the die-and-retry cycle.  But with a little perseverance, I found satisfaction in discovering each new level's design by dying all over it.

And then the spikes came.  And then I had to jump through a spike tunnel.  And died, and died, and died.  I just ... I don't have the reflexes for this kind of thing, anymore.  Maybe I never did.

If you're into the <game:Super Meat Boy> approach to punishing platformers, Ink applies a really cool aesthetic layer to that.  Personally I just can't hack it.
