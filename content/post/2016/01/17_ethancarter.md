{{% game "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" %}}The Vanishing of Ethan Carter{{% /game %}} (more precisely, the Unreal Engine 4 "Redux" release) is probably the most gorgeous game you've ever seen.  Unfortunately, it's also very shallow.

To be fair, the plot of Ethan Carter is actually pretty intriguing, and it's told in a very moody, atmospheric way.  But most of the time I spent with the game had nothing to do with that story -- or with anything, really.  Ethan Carter leans hard into the "walking" part of a Walking Simulator, as its surprisingly-large world is <b>mostly empty</b>.  It also employs a three-dimensional, first-person approach to adventure game "pixel hunting," and so the process of wandering around looking for a tiny clue can be just ... dreadfully boring and forever-taking.

If I was into the {{% game "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" %}}Amnesia{{% /game %}}-style, tense spooky thriller genre, I might be more willing to put up with Ethan Carter's tedious, uninteresting shit.  But purely for its story's sake, I don't have enough patience to see this through.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Dear Esther" %}}Dear Esther{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Gone Home" %}}Gone Home{{% /game %}}  
<b>But god damn</b>: if this game isn't absolutely beautiful.

<i>Progress: Gave up at the church.</i>
