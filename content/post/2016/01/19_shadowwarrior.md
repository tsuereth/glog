I appreciate the juvenile and irreverent humor, and I actually dig being able to slice baddies into finely-articulated gibs.  But having recently come off of {{% game "Wolfenstein: The New Order" %}}Wolfenstein: The New Order{{% /game %}}, the {{% game "Shadow Warrior (2013)" %}}Shadow Warrior{{% /game %}} remake - with relatively scant storytelling and gunplay - fails to make an impact.  This feels more like the "classic" kind of shooter that I was never terribly interested in, while it simultaneously lacks {{% game "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood" %}}The Old Blood{{% /game %}}'s stellar standards of presentation.
