I appreciate the juvenile and irreverent humor, and I actually dig being able to slice baddies into finely-articulated gibs.  But having recently come off of <game:Wolfenstein: The New Order>, the [Shadow Warrior](game:Shadow Warrior (2013)) remake - with relatively scant storytelling and gunplay - fails to make an impact.  This feels more like the "classic" kind of shooter that I was never terribly interested in, while it simultaneously lacks [The Old Blood](game:Wolfenstein: The Old Blood)'s stellar standards of presentation.
