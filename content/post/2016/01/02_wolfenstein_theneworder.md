There is a very short list of complaints I have against [The New Order](game:Wolfenstein: The New Order): The two-timelines mechanic is not compelling enough to make me start a second playthrough; collectibles and upgrades in previous chapters can be missed forever (which, again, not quite compelling enough for a replay); and two or three encounters felt unfair, requiring a specific set of tactics and maneuvers to survive.

Otherwise, and in general, this is an incredibly well-made and captivating game that just happens to be a first-person shooter about killin' Nazis.  It's one of the finest story-driven games I've played, with an impeccable presentation all throughout.  And the gameplay, from knife-throwing to rocket-launching and everything inbetween, is consistently tight and rewarding.

This is the caliber of game everyone should play.  Except those who get squeamish about graphic evisceration and dismemberment, I guess.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Spec Ops: The Line>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:BioShock>, if only because of that game's more-open game world.  
<b>I've never felt quite so emotionally attached</b>: to a game character who just killed hundreds of people.

<i>Progress: Completed on "Bring 'em On" (normal) difficulty.</i>
