I had high hopes for {{% game "Words for Evil" %}}Words for Evil{{% /game %}}, but ended up hating it even more than {{% game "Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey" %}}Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey{{% /game %}}.

My reason is pretty simple.  I was annoyed by Letter Quest because it didn't have very many letters, and spelling satisfying words wasn't usually possible.  Words for Evil has a visibly larger letter field, which is great!, but you can only spell using letters that are <b>next to</b> each other -- which is even more limiting.

Well, there are a few different types of spelling challenge, but the typical "fight an enemy" one requires letter adjacency bullshit, so I don't even care about the other types.  I want a word game that <i>lets you spell things</i> with minimal interference from other mechanics.  Am I really the only one?

<i>Progress: Didn't finish the intro level.</i>
