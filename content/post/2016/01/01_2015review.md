[In 2013]($SiteBaseURL$2014/01/01/2013-in-review-jumping-sneaking-and-dimension-shifting/), I glogged about playing 87 games across 151 posts.  And [in 2014]($SiteBaseURL$2015/01/01/looking-back-on-2014-promises-unfulfilled-schromises-schmunschmulschmilled/), 112 games in 145 posts.

In 2015, I only managed <b>29 games</b> in <b>53 posts</b>.

Sure, I'm in the best shape of my life, have an exciting new job, and even [rearchitected this blog]($SiteBaseURL$2015/10/24/glog-now-with-100-less-server-execution/).  But <i>at what cost?</i>

If there's any semblance of "theme" in my past year's gaming activities, it's re-treading old ground.  Despite my low game count overall, several of them were games I'd already played -- revisiting <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla>, the remaster of [Shadow Complex](game:Shadow Complex Remastered), the PC version of [GTA V](game:Grand Theft Auto V), even <game:SpaceChem> for some reason.  Not to mention <game:Broken Age>'s second half, and [Legacy of the Void](game:StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void) finally finishing off the StarCraft II saga.

And then there was <game:Assassin's Creed Rogue>, which felt quite a lot like I was just playing [Black Flag](game:Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag) again.  And <game:Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell> -- but now I'm falling down a rabbit hole, aren't I.

Breakdown of games played last year:

* <platform:PC>: <b>26</b>
* [Wii U](platform:WiiU): <b>2</b>
* [DS](platform:NDS): <b>1</b> <i>(still only <game:Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story> left)</i>

The good:

* <game:Grand Theft Auto V> on <platform:PC> finally fulfilled the grand crime sandbox's destiny.
* <game:TIS-100> <i>(fucking hell, still in-progress)</i> provided me with a whole new way to hate my stupid monkey brain.
* <game:Wolfenstein: The New Order> <i>(in-progress)</i> has, so far, been more satisfying than I expect a "simple" shooter to be.

The bad:

* <game:Assassin's Creed Rogue>, a clearly-unfinished attempt to spin off of Black Flag, utterly disenchanted me with the entire Assassin's Creed franchise.
* <game:Broken Age>, though good overall, was a letdown in its second act.
* [The Magic Circle (demo)](game:The Magic Circle), which purports to lampoon game production cliches, was itself a game production cliche.

The ugly:

* <game:Batman: Arkham Knight> was a great game, but a [technical travesty]($SiteBaseURL$2015/06/29/the-dark-blue-screen-of-death/).
* <game:Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas> aped a lot of good Zelda features, but was also a bit of a technical mess.
* <game:StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void> was mechanically great, but made a mockery of its story.

Things I'm looking forward to in 2016:

* [Majora's Mask 3D](game:The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D), and all the other stuff I just didn't get to last year.
* <game:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel>, [Mad Max](game:Mad Max (2015)), and the, like, ten million other on-sale games I just bought on Steam.
* Upcoming releases of [The Witness](game:The Witness (2016)), <game:Rise of the Tomb Raider>, [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End), hopefully some kind of immortality serum.
