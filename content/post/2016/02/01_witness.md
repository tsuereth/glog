Imagine the island from {{% game "Myst" %}}Myst{{% /game %}}.  Not the esoteric book-worlds, not the mechanical puzzles, not the grainy FMV animations -- just the mysterious island that you were dropped on, with no introduction, and no directive but to explore, discover, and "solve."  {{% game "The Witness (2016)" %}}The Witness{{% /game %}} brings back that lonely exhiliration, that feeling of an alien land begging to be figured out.

The puzzles start out pretty simple, and you'll blow through a few dozen of them with basically no resistance.  The learning curve is pleasantly <i>subtle</i> - gently introducing new concepts and tricks - and by the time the island feels like it's "opened up" there is a new, bewildering mechanic to encounter at almost every turn.  Outside-the-box stuff.  Revelatory stuff.  Sick shit.

But The Witness would still be a pretty lame game if it was only a series of puzzles, so it's a good thing there's more to it than that.  The puzzles and the <i>exploration</i> punctuate each other every step of the way; following power cables, looking for clues, or merely enjoying the beautiful environment.  The island itself is one big, gorgeous, baffling puzzle.

And I have so much more to discover about it.
