[The Witness](game:The Witness (2016)) starts slow, but ultimately has no problem matching <game:Braid> in terms of mental challenge and intellectual intrigue.

Virtually everything about the game, from tiny puzzle mechanics to world-spanning environmental mysteries, is crafted with such incredible <i>care</i> that it all feels ... real, in a way.  The game's island is just so cohesive, meticulous, and entrancing; it's a thing of beauty, aesthetically and technologically.  It's not hard to understand why Jonathan Blow took so long making this game, and I would certainly call it worthwhile.

Once I'd achieved "Endgame" I went online to research the handful of puzzles I wasn't able to solve on my own -- and in a couple instances, I did feel like the puzzle was kind of stupid.  (Using mechanics in a way that seemed counter to the rest of the game.)  But these accounted for such an infinitesimal proportion of the game's offerings that I really can't ding the overall package for them.

And yet, there are still some things about this game I haven't figured out.  Some of them -- I don't know if anyone has figured out yet.

It's hard to say if The Witness is really for everyone - although it could be?, due to its friendly learning curve - but if you're even remotely interested in puzzles, it's a no-brainer.  Which is good, because you'll need that brain to actually complete it.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Myst>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: maybe <game:Portal 2>, and its humorous narrative?  That's a tough one.  
<b>Anxious to see how it stacks up against</b>: <game:The Talos Principle>
