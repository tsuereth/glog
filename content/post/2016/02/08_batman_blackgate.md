That {{% game "Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate" %}}Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate{{% /game %}} (nevermind the ... <i>unbelievable</i> name) was given to {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Arkham Knight{{% /game %}} purchasers as an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/208650/announcements/detail/128710596358664118">apology</a> for that game's technical troubles, is a Joker-caliber prank.  More than a poor Batman game, and more than a poor game in general, Blackgate is <i>confusingly</i> bad.

Unfortunately, it's easy to see why.  Someone - probably inspired by the Arkham series's {{% game "Metroid Prime" %}}Metroid{{% /game %}}-like world design - pitched a 2D, sidescrolling Batman game; like, you know, {{% game "Super Metroid" %}}Metroid{{% /game %}}.  And then someone else - probably inspired by the fantastic critical and commercial success of {{% game "Batman: Arkham Asylum" %}}Arkham Asylum{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Batman: Arkham City" %}}City{{% /game %}} - decided that this game absolutely must contain <b>all</b> of the core gameplay mechanics of the 3D Arkham games.

The <i>soul-crushing</i> result is a 3D game crammed into 2D by accident.  Don't misunderstand -- {{% game "Shadow Complex Remastered" %}}Shadow Complex{{% /game %}}, for example, was a 2D game with some inappropriately-administered 3D gameplay.  But in Blackgate, Batman has to punch enemies coming at him from all angles while he can only move in two directions.  In Blackgate, Batman's routes through the map are eternally limited by the golden paths encoded into the map.  In Blackgate, "depth" and "verticality" are merely poorly-messaged quicktime prompts.

The game is borderline unplayable.  It's <i>certainly</i> not fun.  The groan-worthy writing, shitty-looking moving-comic cutscenes, button-prompt bugs, and just-plain-bad "hacking" puzzles barely even factor into it.

The thing that confuses me about Blackgate is that this game made it all the way to release.  By all rights, it should have been cancelled before the public even knew about it.

What's most disappointing about Blackgate isn't that it's associated with an otherwise-great franchise, or even that its fundamentally-broken game design should never have been greenlit.  What's most disappointing is that Kevin Conroy and other legitimately-talented voice actors wasted their time.

<i>Progress: Barely even got into Blackgate Penitentiary at all.  My god.  It's just so terrible.</i>
