For the first 20 minutes or so, all I wanted to do was ignore <game:Murdered: Soul Suspect>'s incredibly ham-fisted narration.  But I couldn't!  The game's introduction, at least, is painfully cutscene-heavy, and written with all the elegance and subtlety of an <a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Psychic_Tandem_War_Elephant">Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant</a>.  Yes, let's jump-cut between a bunch of three-second flashbacks in the protagonist's life that happen to directly establish his personality and his relevant relationships to other characters.  And then add some more non-interactive bits that literally reiterate the game's plot, and mandatory dialog sessions that serve as nothing more than a dressed-up text tutorial.

The game's sense of storytelling is an ironic interpretation of the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell">show, don't tell</a>" principle.  Just because the rigorously-methodical writing is "shown" in a cutscene doesn't ... ugh.  It's not good.

Oh, but then the gameplay actually started.  And I felt like I wasn't missing much.  Walking around looking for clue signposts, hiding from demons ([Solid Snake](game:Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes)-style), and collecting collectibles that you have no reason to care about.

Murdered doesn't just lean heavily on its poorly-told story, it has thoroughly underwhelming game mechanics to boot.  I can give it the benefit of the doubt and believe that, as the story proceeds, it might become less painful to sit through.  But the game itself is <i>mundane</i> almost as soon as it starts.

<i>Progress: Didn't even make it to the 4th floor.</i>
