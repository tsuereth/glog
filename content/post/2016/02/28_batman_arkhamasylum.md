Circling back after {{% game "Batman: Arkham City" %}}Arkham City{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Knight{{% /game %}}, there <i>are</i> some parts of {{% game "Batman: Arkham Asylum" %}}Batman: Arkham Asylum{{% /game %}} that show their age a little.  Some maneuvering and takedown tactics don't exist yet, and the combat controls aren't <i>quite</i> as solid as they became in the sequels.

But it's still a damned fine game today, and I'd say it still does two things better than its followers did: having a really moody, self-contained storyline; and not spraying an absurd amount of The Riddler's bullshit all over the map.

Yeah, it holds up pretty well.
