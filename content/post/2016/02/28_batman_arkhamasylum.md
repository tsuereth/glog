Circling back after [Arkham City](game:Batman: Arkham City) and [Knight](game:Batman: Arkham Knight), there <i>are</i> some parts of <game:Batman: Arkham Asylum> that show their age a little.  Some maneuvering and takedown tactics don't exist yet, and the combat controls aren't <i>quite</i> as solid as they became in the sequels.

But it's still a damned fine game today, and I'd say it still does two things better than its followers did: having a really moody, self-contained storyline; and not spraying an absurd amount of The Riddler's bullshit all over the map.

Yeah, it holds up pretty well.
