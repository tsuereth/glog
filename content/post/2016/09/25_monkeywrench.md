<game:Monkey Wrench> is a mobile puzzle game.  I have no problem calling it "little" and "dumb."  The fact that it's occupied dozens of hours of my time over the past several months, I've spent more money on it than any other Android app (buying new puzzles), and I'm still not done with it, is ancillary to its little-ness and dumb-ness.

Monkey Wrench's style of word-finding puzzles is <i>just</i> more complicated enough than a traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search">word search</a> to be interesting, and to pat myself on the back I do think that the pattern-recognition element of the game is a good way to keep the brain's gears turning.

Mostly, though, it's something to keep me occupied while I'm waiting for something else to download, or stuck in a meeting, or on the toilet.  Apparently that's worth over 1250 puzzles and counting.
