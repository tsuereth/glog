[Hearthfire](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Hearthfire) doesn't add quests or maps to [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim); it just adds the ability to build houses.  (And to marry an NPC, and adopt NPC children, but ugh, who cares.)

The house-building project, though, is oddly satisfying; collecting the necessarily materials to erect and upgrade your mansion feels like a whole new mini-campaign, and the visual reward of exploring your house is even rewarding, in its own way.

Hearthfire doesn't add a whole lot to Skyrim, but what it does add is pretty, pretty good.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Saints Row IV: Enter the Dominatrix>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard>  
<b>Comparable to</b>: base-building in <game:World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor>, but better because it's less annoyingly demanding.
