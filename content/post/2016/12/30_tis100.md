I spent over a year stuck on a single puzzle in <game:TIS-100>: "Sequence Sorter."  Today I finally finished it.  <b><i>Yes</i></b>.  (I almost had to include this game in yet another end-of-year recap post.)

Although it continues to infuriate me with its limited amount of data (and instruction!) memory, TIS-100 successfully replicates the euphoric rush of fixing some ugly code and watching the computer tear through its task.

Now that I've finished the main menu of puzzles, I can finally feel good about moving on to <game:Infinifactory> and <game:Shenzhen I/O>.  <i>Oh, Zachtronics.  You spoil me.</i>

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Human Resource Machine>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:SpaceChem> (arguably, if only for having less content)  
<b>Maybe I will come back to do the "Directory" puzzles</b>: sometime in 2018.

<i>Progress: Repaired all "Segment Map" nodes.</i>
