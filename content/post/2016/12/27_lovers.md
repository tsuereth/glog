<game:Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime> is a really great example of a game that could be played seriously, but is still fun in a haphazard party.  Like <game:New Super Mario Bros. Wii> or [3D World](game:Super Mario 3D World), in that sense.  Also there are space lasers.  <i>And space flails.</i>

Lovers does lean a bit more toward the "hard" angle, though, which makes it more difficult to enjoy once your party - disorganized, or drunk, or both, as they may be - hits the wall.  Restarting from an unexpected death is not as convenient as in Nintendo's genre experiments; and so it's harder to learn from your mistakes, since you have to re-do a lot of the level just to get to those mistakes again.

It's a very cool idea, though, and one I look forward to trying more in the future.
