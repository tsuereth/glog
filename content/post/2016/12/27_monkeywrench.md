Other than [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition), this is the game I've been dumping the most hours into.

I'm over 2200 puzzles deep, now.  I will watch this game die.

<game:Monkey Wrench> is far from the most interesting game I've played, or the most technically impressive, or the most inexplicably immersive.  But it delivers more on the "play anytime, anywhere" mobile-gaming goal than any other I've tried.

A couple months back, Blue Ox released new puzzle packs covering their previous "daily" puzzles; so I was able to do the ones that came out before I started playing, up through June.  Hopefully, after the new year, they'll release a July through December pack and <i>then I will have played every puzzle</i>, because this is important to me, for some ungodly reason.
