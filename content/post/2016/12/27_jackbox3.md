The Jackbox party packs are always good at having <i>some</i> minigames that parties can giddily revisit, again and again.  [Jackbox 3](game:The Jackbox Party Pack 3) is remarkable for having, if I dare say so, <i>no</i> weak entries; all of these games are a hoot.

<b>Quiplash 2</b> is a predicable, and still awesome, follow-up to the original "write a good joke" prompting game.  <b>Trivia Murder Party</b> is a fun spin on a traditional trivia game, with madcap mechanics (like lopping off pinkies) that keep it from getting stale.  <b>Guesspionage</b> is like Family Feud, but with more adversarial yelling!  <b>Fakin' It</b> is a bit hard to understand, but really gets going once you realize that all of your friends - at least the ones you play Jackbox with - are dirty, filthy liars.

The surprise standout, though, is <b>Tee K.O.</b>, which is not as much a game as it is an art project.  After drawing whatever you want, and writing whatever slogans you want, t-shirt designs get made out of arbitrary combinations of these drawings and slogans.  And then there are rounds of voting on the best combinations, but that's hardly the point.  <i>You can buy these t-shirts.</i>

I drew a Pac-Man ghost, and wrote "Eat a bag of dicks," and now my friend owns that on a t-shirt.

We live in an age of wonder.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Jackbox Party Pack>, <game:The Jackbox Party Pack 2>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: No, this is the legit best party game so far.  
<b>Yes, even competitive with</b>: Cards Against Humanity
