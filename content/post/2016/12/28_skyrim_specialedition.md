So the {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition" %}}Special Edition{{% /game %}} of Skyrim has updated graphics, and unfortunately reintroduces ages-old bugs ({{% game "BioShock Remastered" %}}gee, where have I heard that before{{% /game %}}).  Sure thing -- whatever.

What really drew me into this remaster was finally having an excuse to play the DLCs I bought forever ago, but never started: {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard" %}}Dawnguard{{% /game %}}, {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Hearthfire" %}}Hearthfire{{% /game %}}, and {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dragonborn" %}}Dragonborn{{% /game %}}.  Thoughts on those to be enumerated separately.  Along the way, though, I found myself very easily re-immersed in Skyrim's huge world, innumerable quests, and addictive skill-ups.

{{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" %}}Last time around{{% /game %}}, I was a magic-using sneak-thief.  This time, I'm an archering sneak-thief.  ... yeah, really not all that different.  I'm still methodically looting every house and dungeon, and I'm still gradually climbing the ranks of every organization on the map.  Even though I'm re-treading a lot of the same ground from the game's original release, and even though it remains full of embarrassing Bethesda bugs, I'm still having a ton of fun with it.

I should have no problem breaking my 140-hour record from last time.  (I'm already at 127.)

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "BioShock Remastered" %}}BioShock Remastered{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: the remastered {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla{{% /game %}}, I guess  
<b>And obviously better than, if only technically</b>: {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" %}}The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim{{% /game %}}
