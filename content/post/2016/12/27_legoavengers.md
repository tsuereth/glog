One might wonder why there's <i>another</i> LEGO Marvel game after <game:LEGO Marvel Super Heroes>, other than "for more money."  I, for example, still wonder this.

On the one hand: From the outset, <game:LEGO Marvel's Avengers> sets out to be "more" than its predecessor, with more characters, more locations, and more movie plots to tie-in to.

On the other hand: After almost two hours, I still didn't yet make it to an open-world segment.  Linear missions have never been the LEGO series' strong point.  And while this game doesn't <i>literally</i> re-tread Super Heroes' ground, it feels an awful lot like it does.

I would like to come back to Avengers eventually, if only to play the Ant-Man stage, because Ant-Man is fucking cool.  But having already played through Marvel Super Heroes, this game's offerings aren't very appealing.
