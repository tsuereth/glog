I first saw <game:Phrase Shift> pop up on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/535980/">Steam store</a>, and I thought -- you know, this looks like it would work better as a mobile game.  Lo and behold, it had already been out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.hyperhippo.phraseshift">Google Play</a> for some time; and yeah, it did work really well with a touchscreen.

And I did have fun with it for a while, because hey, word games are cool.  But it's hard for this game to stand in the shadow of <game:Monkey Wrench> when it has <i>so much</i> less content, and also feels like it is growing that content more slowly.  (Phrase Shift has daily puzzles, but each puzzle is significantly smaller than one of Monkey Wrench's.)

It's certainly not a bad timewaster, and I don't regret spending $2 on it, but I've stopped bothering to check it on a daily basis.

<b>Better than</b>: A crossword puzzle  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Monkey Wrench>  
<b>Unfortunately, the "harder" words</b>: actually tend to be easier, as they are longer, and include more clues.
