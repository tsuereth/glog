Sure, [Job Simulator](game:Job Simulator: The 2050 Archives) fits firmly in the realm of first-round, relatively-light VR games; years from now, when virtual experiences have become several iterations more complex, it's unlikely that anyone will remember it.

But the genius of Job Simulator is that it's hit upon the most entertaining part of current VR technology, which is <b>simulated throwing</b>.  Although it's dressed up in a variety of ways, and the sense of humor helps to sell it, all of the most fun parts of Job Simulator are when you're using the Vive controllers to pick up an object and then toss it -- into a trash can, at a non-player character, or just anywhere in the virtual room.

It's a highly enjoyable application of VR, and has me seriously considering the purchase of <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/358040/">hundreds of dollars of equipment</a> just to play it whenever I want.
