<game:Pokémon Picross> allows you to assemble a party of pocket monsters and take them across a map made up of picross puzzles.  It's more than a little absurd.

The Pokémon aspect of the game means that you can use abilities to simplify a puzzle, like adding hints or slowing the game clock.  ... Since my personal interest is in <i>solving</i> the puzzles, not shortcutting or cheating them, this has absolutely no value to me.  There is a whole world of party management, like in a real Pokémon game, that I never got close to touching because all it would do is dilute the effect of the puzzles.

But I don't care at all about that shortcoming relative to Pokémon Picross's economic problem.  It's a free-to-play game, and there is a clear paywall around where I stopped, such that there's no realistic way for me to make progress without buying more "picrites" (in-game currency) for real money.  Earning picrites for free is not only slow, but would require me to <i>grindily</i> re-play puzzles I've already solved, which is pretty damned stupid.

I barely even got a chance to get frustrated by the game's energy mechanic, which actually limits the number of tiles I can mark over time.  That is, as you consume energy by solving puzzles, you'll reach a point where you have to <i>wait</i> for energy to re-accumulate before solving the next one.

It's entirely possible that, if I were to pay to unlock more levels and un-limit my energy, there could be a thrillingly-competent picross game in here (the game map certainly looks large enough for it).  But in terms of overall design, <b>the game assumes that I'm not interested in solving puzzles</b>, which is very distasteful and off-putting.

<b>Better than</b>: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess>  
<b>Nevermind the stupid control scheme</b>: Which forces you to use <i>either</i> the stylus or face buttons, and doesn't allow you to switch without going to the options menu.

<i>Progress: Got to the end of Area 04</i>
