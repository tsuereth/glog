Playing {{% game "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" %}}the first Uncharted{{% /game %}} again on {{% platform "PS4" %}}PS4{{% /platform %}} - more poignantly, playing it again after Drake's {{% game "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves" %}}second{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception" %}}third{{% /game %}} outings - it's really hard to ignore its flaws.  The sloppy gunplay, and that there's <i>so much</i> of it, with wave after wave of faceless militia inconveniently interrupting the storytelling--

Oh, did I {{% abslink href="2010/12/25/uncharted-drakes-fortune-2/" %}}already complain about this{{% /abslink %}}?  Huh.

Yeah, it's still just <b>bad</b>.  (Here's hoping for that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464335/">film adaptation</a>.)

<i>Progress: Somewhere in the stupid jungle.  Who can tell.</i>
