Playing [the first Uncharted](game:Uncharted: Drake's Fortune) again on <platform:PS4> - more poignantly, playing it again after Drake's [second](game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves) and [third](game:Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception) outings - it's really hard to ignore its flaws.  The sloppy gunplay, and that there's <i>so much</i> of it, with wave after wave of faceless militia inconveniently interrupting the storytelling--

Oh, did I [already complain about this]($SiteBaseURL$2010/12/25/uncharted-drakes-fortune-2/)?  Huh.

Yeah, it's still just <b>bad</b>.  (Here's hoping for that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1464335/">film adaptation</a>.)

<i>Progress: Somewhere in the stupid jungle.  Who can tell.</i>
