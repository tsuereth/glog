Reading the <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2016/05/11/civilization-6-in-development-for-pc-releases-in-october/">feature promises</a> for [Civ 6](game:Sid Meier's Civilization VI), it's pretty clear that this - and not [Beyond Earth](game:Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth) - was always meant to be the next step in the franchise after [Civ 5: Brave New World](game:Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World).  So, it's good to see that progress is being made on truly enhancing and tuning the core Civilization game.

And I guess I'm glad that I never sprung for Beyond Earth, now.
