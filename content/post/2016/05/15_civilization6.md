Reading the <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2016/05/11/civilization-6-in-development-for-pc-releases-in-october/">feature promises</a> for {{% game "Sid Meier's Civilization VI" %}}Civ 6{{% /game %}}, it's pretty clear that this - and not {{% game "Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth" %}}Beyond Earth{{% /game %}} - was always meant to be the next step in the franchise after {{% game "Sid Meier's Civilization V: Brave New World" %}}Civ 5: Brave New World{{% /game %}}.  So, it's good to see that progress is being made on truly enhancing and tuning the core Civilization game.

And I guess I'm glad that I never sprung for Beyond Earth, now.
