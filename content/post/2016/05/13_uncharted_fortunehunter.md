{{% game "Uncharted: Fortune Hunter" %}}Uncharted: Fortune Hunter{{% /game %}} is a pretty great-looking mobile game, and even includes some <i>fun</i>, if you can believe it.  Block and movement puzzles, you know?

But its bite-sized appeal is hampered somewhat by long loading times, and at least in the early game, the puzzles themselves are more laborious than they are clever -- flipping all the switches to see what they do, and waiting for Drake to finish walking to his destination.

It's a cool idea, and has a lot of graphical polish, but I think could have used some more gameplay polish.  ... And seriously, those load times, come on.

<i>Progress: Completed 6 puzzles.</i>
