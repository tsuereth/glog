Maybe it's a <i>tad</i> overwrought, but [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End)'s ending hits all the right emotional notes, satisfyingly wrapping up Nathan Drake's stories with a pleasantly open-ended bow.

Uncharted 4 isn't better than its predecessors because of its amazing graphics -- even though they are, really, totally goddamned incredible.  It's better than its predecessors because of its strategic and well-executed gameplay innovations.  When Drake careens down a steep slope, grapples to a tree branch, swings across a ravine and narrowly avoids a grim fate by jamming a piton into a sheer cliff, it's just ... man.  It's exhilirating.

(The driving segments are also kind of cool, but probably would have overstayed their welcome if they were any more frequent.)

What I can't really speak for is the shooting gameplay, because the last three games taught me that I would probably hate it anyway.  I fully recognize that Explorer difficulty is way, way easy, and I don't care because I would <i>much</i> rather plow through fields of enemies without even trying, than have to suffer through multiple die-and-retry cycles every time a bullet-sponge juggernaut catches me between cover spots.

But I digress.  Assuming that the gunplay isn't really important - because, to me, it isn't - Uncharted 4 is a shining jewel in the franchise and a triumph of interactive storytelling.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: Oh, forget it.  
<b>Whatever Naughty Dog does next</b>: I can't wait to see it.
