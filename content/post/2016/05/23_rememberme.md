Starting <game:Remember Me> so soon after [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End) was definitely a mistake.  Both games prominently feature acrobatic environment traversal and dialog-based storytelling, and the latter blows the former out of the water in both cases.  Hell, combo-based combat is an <i>afterthought</i> in Uncharted, and it still works better than Remember Me's, which thus far seems to be more dodge-based than attack-based.

Even the memory remixing sequence I did in Episode 1 was pretty underwhelming.  Setting aside that a crucial bit of the controls weren't explained properly (a UI prompt that looked like "click the left stick" actually meant "move the left stick down") it really just feels like a hidden object game with a time dimension.

Nothing about Remember Me is necessarily bad - except the game's silly-sounding future vocabulary, that sure is - but it all feels tepid, like a halfhearted imitation of other AAA games.  There is still time for the game to surprise me, but at this point it has a distinct jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none thing going on.
