It was an unclear button prompt that pushed me to finally give up on <game:Remember Me>, but this habit is far from the game's biggest problem.

Remember Me focuses too heavily on its boring environment traversal and its repetitive combat.  Fights don't take long to become very un-fun; as the camera weaves around like a maniac, combos reset when another enemy gets in the way, and enemy attacks require you to dodge over and over and over and over... the customizable combo system might be cool if encounters actually gave you the chance to fully execute a lengthy combo, but they seem determined to prevent this.

And while I wasn't wild about the one memory remix I got to do, I would have welcomed another one just to break up the monotony of running through slums and dodging "leaper" attacks.  At least it would have been more narratively interesting than a voice on a radio shoving story beats down my throat.

Remember Me makes surprisingly poor use of the tools it has for keeping the player engaged.  Even given the lack of polish in each of its design components, the haphazardly-assembled experience ends up feeling like <i>less</i> than the sum of its parts.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Jumper: Griffin's Story>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time>, <game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves>  
<b>Still can't get over</b>: The nonsense vocabulary.  Sensen.  Remembrane.  Comfortress.  <i>Errorist.</i>  It all just sounds so... stupid.

<i>Progress: Didn't finish Episode 3.</i>
