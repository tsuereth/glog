I remarked to multiple other E3-observers that I literally <b>did not believe</b> that Nintendo was capable of making a game like the <a href="https://gfycat.com/SharpFlamboyantImperatorangel">one they just showed</a>.  I would be more inclined to believe that it was a <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/09/12">bullshot fabrication</a> than a real product of Nintendo EAD's traditional, tightly-scripted assembly lines.

So hearing that <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2016/06/20/xenoblade-chronicles-dev-working-on-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">an open-world RPG developer is actually doing it</a> makes a lot, lot more sense.  Which is good, because now I can actually believe that this refreshingly-free-spirited adventure might really exist.
