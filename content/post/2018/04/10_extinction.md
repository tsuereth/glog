<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/5866/extinction?tab=1">Dull, repetitive, boring, camera problems</a>.  Well, that's a shame.

From watching gameplay footage, it looks like - although trash-clearing and civilian-rescuing technically constitute "gameplay" - {{% game "Extinction" %}}Extinction{{% /game %}} took a pretty direct route from proof-of-concept to retail release.  Reviews agree that the ogre fights become redundant quickly, and that the game's world and characters simply aren't compelling.  Not much meat on these bones.

I still like the premise, the elevator pitch of Extinction -- if it was surrounded by more robust mechanics and world-building, like a {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor" %}}Shadow of Mordor{{% /game %}} or {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" %}}Breath of the Wild{{% /game %}}.  Maybe a sequel or a spiritual successor will push the needle further.
