<game:Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight> does <i>some</i> things well.  The combat mechanics are easy to learn, and have a bit of satisfying depth; upgrades come at a good pace and feel meaningful; regions have distinctive visual and audio themes.  And the map is a good-enough example of non-linear Metroidvania layout, given how short the game is.

But - <i>despite</i> how short it is - Reverie fails to make a meaningful impression.  Its mechanics aren't special, its art style is unremarkable, and its story is threadbare, supported by a handful of impersonal lines and a small cast of incredibly flat characters.  Even with NPCs, this game feels deader and emptier than [Metroid](game:Metroid: Zero Mission) or <game:Super Metroid>.

Without interesting gameplay or narrative stakes, the map itself was the only motivation I had to keep playing.  And that isn't a great motivation.

Only one anecdote stands out in my memory, and it isn't a good one.  I got to the final boss, killed it, and then ... died, cinematically?, clearly having received a "bad ending."  But as I could only muster the slimmest margin of interest, I looked up how to get the "good ending" online, which was to backtrack for a groan-worthy hidden item, then re-fight the boss.  It doesn't feel reasonable to me that a needle in a haystack is the only way out of a disappointing ending.

(Granted, even the good ending is pretty bland and unfulfilling.)

Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is competent enough in its fundamentals, but just doesn't have anything noteworthy to say for itself.  I don't regret the three-and-a-half hours I spent with it, but have no interest in hunting down its secrets -- nor in trying the rest of the Momodora series.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut>, if only just.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition>, which wasn't really my favorite, either.  
<b>Hard to say if better or worse than</b>: <game:Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition>; at least that was memorable, albeit frustrating as shit.

<i>Progress: Got the True Ending, 98\% map completion.</i>
