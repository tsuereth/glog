The ending is ... okay.  Like the rest of {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of War" %}}Shadow of War{{% /game %}}'s story, it somehow manages to simultaneously feel <i>cool</i> and <i>bizarre</i>.  The final act is pretty impressive, but more for its visual flair and its new gameplay than for any narrative payoff.

When I say "final act," I mean <i>Act III: Shadow and Flames</i>.  This linear capstone on Act II's open-world orc-slaughter represents the cinematic culmination of Talion's struggle against Sauron.

... but then, the game keeps going.  Non-spoiler: no, Talion doesn't defeat Sauron in some alternate-universe retelling of Tolkien's stories.  Instead, the <i>Epilogue: Shadow Wars</i> shows Talion <b>continuing</b> his sisyphean toil against the uruk legions.  After conquering each of the game world's five fortresses, now, they must be defended!

I did the first defense stage, with attackers somewhat below my level, and it was pretty easy.  Then the second, with attackers near my level, and it was kind of hard.  I saw the third stage had some attackers <i>above</i> my level.  And then I looked up how many stages there are.  <i>Ten?</i>

Evidently, Shadow Wars requires a hell of a lot more grinding through orcs, leveling-up, captain-promoting, and warchief-buffing, with absolutely no narrative integration until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrvUhstlMQ">the very end</a>.

By electing <i>not</i> to continue this tiring routine, I'm departing Shadow of War with a high opinion of it.  Building my army and conquering Mordor was way fun.  After 40 hours of it, though, I've got no interest in the epilogue -- nor in its awkward-sounding DLCs.

({{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of War - The Blade of Galadriel" %}}Blade of Galadriel{{% /game %}} strips out the Nemesis system?  And {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of War - The Desolation of Mordor" %}}Desolation of Mordor{{% /game %}} removes respawning?  Nah, thanks.)

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor" %}}Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Agents of Mayhem" %}}Agents of Mayhem{{% /game %}}

<b>Boy, if they try to sequelize this <i>again</i></b>: Monolith will really have their lore-work cut out for them.
