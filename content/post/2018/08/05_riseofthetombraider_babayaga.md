Mid-game DLC is an interesting experiment, and to its credit, {{% game "Rise of the Tomb Raider: Baba Yaga - The Temple of the Witch" %}}Baba Yaga{{% /game %}} integrates well into {{% game "Rise of the Tomb Raider" %}}Rise of the Tomb Raider{{% /game %}}'s first non-linear hub area.  ... as well as anything else works in that hub, anyway.

But this content suffers from the same key shortcoming as the main game: it just isn't very interesting.  There's one sequence that's pretty cool-looking, with hallucinatory flashbacks and trippy visuals -- you know, <i>just like</i> the Scarecrow sequences in {{% tag "Batman: Arkham" %}}the Batman games{{% /tag %}}.  (And the poison dart scene in {{% game "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception" %}}Uncharted 3{{% /game %}}.)  It feels overwhelmingly like a rip-off.

Other than that, there isn't much to this DLC.  A fidgety puzzle, a frustrating boss fight, and a "twist" that's telegraphed a mile away by collectible audio diaries.  Yep -- Baba Yaga is more of the same, for Rise of the Tomb Raider.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "BioShock 2: Minerva's Den Remastered" %}}BioShock 2: Minerva's Den{{% /game %}}  
<b>At least it's better than</b>: {{% abslink href="2015/06/30/almost-the-game-gotham-deserves/" %}}that Harley Quinn mini-fight DLC, in Arkham Knight{{% /abslink %}}.
