Mid-game DLC is an interesting experiment, and to its credit, [Baba Yaga](game:Rise of the Tomb Raider: Baba Yaga - The Temple of the Witch) integrates well into <game:Rise of the Tomb Raider>'s first non-linear hub area.  ... as well as anything else works in that hub, anyway.

But this content suffers from the same key shortcoming as the main game: it just isn't very interesting.  There's one sequence that's pretty cool-looking, with hallucinatory flashbacks and trippy visuals -- you know, <i>just like</i> the Scarecrow sequences in [the Batman games](tag:Batman: Arkham).  (And the poison dart scene in [Uncharted 3](game:Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception).)  It feels overwhelmingly like a rip-off.

Other than that, there isn't much to this DLC.  A fidgety puzzle, a frustrating boss fight, and a "twist" that's telegraphed a mile away by collectible audio diaries.  Yep -- Baba Yaga is more of the same, for Rise of the Tomb Raider.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla - Demons of the Badlands>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: [BioShock 2: Minerva's Den](game:BioShock 2: Minerva's Den Remastered)  
<b>At least it's better than</b>: [that Harley Quinn mini-fight DLC, in Arkham Knight]($SiteBaseURL$2015/06/30/almost-the-game-gotham-deserves/).
