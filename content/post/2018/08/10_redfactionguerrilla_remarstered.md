Red Faction: Guerrilla and I are <i>well-acquainted</i>; nothing in its {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered" %}}Re-Mars-tered edition{{% /game %}} will be a surprise to me.  Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tgAJtvRP70">three minutes of Dunkey</a> was enough to make me yearn once more for the joy of demolition and some screwball physics.

Guerrilla is getting on in years, though, and it shows.  This Re-Mars-tering helps the game <i>look</i> modern - it really does! - and even the controls and mechanical depth feel contemporary enough.  But the muted color palette and dull level design, not to mention a 90s B-movie plot, become more immersion-breaking with each passing year.

Then again, I haven't even gotten the Rocket Launcher yet.  That should distract me from the red-brown desert.

Nine years later, it's funny to me that some of RFG's most distinctive features still haven't been copied into more games.  Not just Geo-Mod destructibility -- but its discoverable, dynamic-feeling "Guerrilla Missions," and how civilians react to high morale by joining your fight.  These are things that would feel right at home in <a href="http://www.pointandclickbait.com/2014/06/ubisoft-game-review/">Ubisoft Game</a>.

Between "{{% game "Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition" %}}Deathinitive{{% /game %}}," "{{% game "Darksiders Warmastered Edition" %}}Warmastered{{% /game %}}," and now "Re-Mars-tered" editions of THQ's old games, THQ Nordic has established a clear pattern.  I really hope it leads to a "Resanctified" version of {{% game "Saints Row 2" %}}Saints Row 2{{% /game %}} or maybe a "Waterfront Genkification" edition of {{% game "Saints Row: The Third" %}}The Third{{% /game %}}.  (And I hope Volition comes up with better puns than mine.)
