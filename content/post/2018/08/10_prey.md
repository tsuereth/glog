I knew, going into {{% game "Prey (2017)" %}}Prey{{% /game %}}, to expect some {{% tag "BioShock" %}}BioShock{{% /tag %}}-like immersive storytelling.  And it's delivering on that front, with a really intriguing plot that I'm anxious to unravel by reading notes and chasing down mysteries.

What I didn't expect was how much gameplay feels borrowed from {{% tag "Deus Ex" %}}Deus Ex{{% /tag %}}.  And I <b>love it</b>.  The best parts of {{% game "Deus Ex: Human Revolution" %}}Human Revolution{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided" %}}Mankind Divided{{% /game %}} were when my character choices led to options and openness in a mission - investing in strength opens a barricaded door, investing in hacking reveals a locked room's passcode - and Prey looks like a whole game's worth of that.

Prey absolutely nails its aesthetic and theme, too, using both weathered and fresh in-game narrative techniques to make its sci-fi setting feel seamless.  From notes scribbled on whiteboards and "science-y" weapons like the Gloo Cannon, to the mechanical foundations of the intro/tutorial sequence, every aspect of the game feels both natural within the world, and exciting to see and play with.  It's a real triumph of first-person world-building.

From what I've seen so far, anyway.  I'm making slow progress because of how meticulous I'm being in exploring Talos I, and collecting all the scrap material I can find.

Also, I'm terrified of the phantoms.  Huge kudos to the visual and audio design that makes Prey's enemies so surprisingly <i>intimidating</i>.  This is a feeling I've not felt since {{% game "Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition" %}}RE4{{% /game %}}'s chainsaw man.

<i>Progress: Skulking around in the Machine Shop.</i>
