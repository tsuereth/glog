Back when I replayed Guerrilla's "Steam Edition," [I said]($SiteBaseURL$2015/12/20/the-red-faction-is-dead-long-live-the-red-faction/) that <i>"I don't need a new open-world destruction game, at least not yet.  This one is still good."</i>

Well, three years on, it's still good.  But my desire for a successor is growing.

Driving trucks through buildings, solving destruction puzzles a'la <game:Blast Corps>, and whacking Mars-nazis with a hammer like you're at the driving range; all of this remains super-duper fun.  Meanwhile, the lifeless B-grade plot, the terribly sparse Badlands map, and bugs (like progression loss, or crashing during the final mission!); these feel more prominent and detrimental than they used to.

At its high points, like slinging rockets at EDF jets or mowing down soldiers with a mech walker, there's still <i>nothing else</i> quite like RF:G.  And I hope that doesn't remain true -- since its low points are feeling more and more antiquated.

Kudos to this game's re-Mars-terers; here's hoping for the next one.  (I'm legit stoked for any <tag:Saints Row> remaster.)  And beyond that, I hope that THQ Nordic someday sees fit to <i>top</i> Guerrilla with a new, not-a-corridor-shooter Red Faction installment.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Agents of Mayhem>, I would argue.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: it felt 8-9 years ago.  
<b>Sometime soon</b>: I'll have to check out how <game:The Saboteur> has held up.

<i>Progress: 20 missions and 43 guerrilla actions completed.</i>
