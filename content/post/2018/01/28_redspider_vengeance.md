Considering it's a completely-free visual novel, a lot of things about <game:Red Spider: Vengeance> didn't surprise me -- like the typos, the simple art, the unpolished UI, and the laughably bad sound effects.  But there were two big things that really <i>did</i> surprise me.

The first was that it told a pretty good story!  Granted, some of the dialog (and inner-monologue) lines could use some cleaning up, but the plot and the characterization are all in line with real, commercial-quality crime drama.  Its Hong Kong setting and crime-syndicate themes feel just as evocative as <game:Sleeping Dogs> did, even though this game is <i>text-based</i>.  And at around 80 minutes of reading, the length feels on par with a full-length film.

The second thing that surprised me was that I made <b>one choice</b> in my entire playthrough.  It was fairly early on (maybe around the 10 minute mark), and the rest of the game simply played out as I clicked through the text.  Despite there being plenty of obvious opportunities for the main character to make a decision - as well as a handful of scenes that could have been quick-time events, in the style of a [Telltale](tag:Telltale Games) game - almost all of this story is non-interactive.

<i>(According to the in-game "route map," there was a second choice that happened even before my first.  But either by bug or by design, there was only one option for me to click on.  I suspect that the second option doesn't become available until playing through the first option's storyline.)</i>

As much as I admire this story, I'm really not interested in replaying the whole thing to experience five more variations of it.

... That said, I <i>am</i> slightly curious about [the prequel](game:Red Spider 2: Exiled).

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Hate Plus>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Analogue: A Hate Story>  
<b>Debatably better than</b>: [The Walking Dead](game:The Walking Dead), in terms of narrative quality.
