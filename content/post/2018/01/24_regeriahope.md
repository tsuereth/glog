Considering it's a fan-game that's clearly ... <i>inspired by</i> <tag:Ace Attorney>, [Regeria Hope](game:Regeria Hope Episode 1) brings a couple of surprisingly-fresh ideas to the table.

The first is testimony selection: You, as the defense attorney, can help script your client's testimony.  He may plan on some statement that could, uh, <i>damage</i> the case, which you can rephrase or remove entirely.  It's an interesting twist on Phoenix Wright's prescribed dialog - imagine if you could actually tell Larry Butz to be less of a goddamned idiot! - albeit limited to a pretty small portion of the trial.

The other is that you can intentionally <b>throw the case</b>.  Which is, ehh, <i>not great</i> in terms of a defense attorney's story.  But I suppose that part of the game author's grand plan is a Telltale-style branching story?  Maybe it would be more significant in a multi-chapter career mode, ... but this feature is hard to appraise in only a single episode.

And aside from those new ideas, this first episode of Regeria Hope is mostly what you'd expect of Phoenix Wright fan-fiction.  The plot is pretty-well telegraphed, the dialog has its fair share of typos, the Unity-default GUI is just-a-bit shameful, and the narrative isn't as much "branching" as it is <i>a branch</i> of what the author thought seemed interesting.

If Regeria Hope's author can iterate on this strategy, then I might really look forward to a Phoenix Wright rival.  But in the meantime, Hope seems pretty-well sequestered to "fanfic" - and if you're looking for a prosecutor-versus-defendant adventure with <i>credentials</i>, <game:Aviary Attorney> is a better bet than this imitator.

<b>Better than</b>: [Phoenix Wright: Asinine Attorney](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice: Phoenix Wright - Asinine Attorney), an officially-sanctioned fan-game disaster.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Aviary Attorney>, a fan game with its own intriguing characters and plot.  
<b>Really, author</b>: You can do better, if you recognize that the strength of Ace Attorney isn't <i>suits and ties</i>, but the interaction of uniquely interesting characters.  Larry was a great foil for Phoenix because their childhood friendship conflicted with the Steel Samurai case.  How can you make me <i>care about</i> Brock 'En Hart?  What's my <i>motivation</i>?
