<game:Escape the Game>'s fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness isn't great, but not as bad as [some](game:The Magic Circle) [others](game:Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard) I've played.  And the gameplay is rote at first, but quickly adds a grappling-hook power that makes the game feel fast, and interesting.

And then it's over.  In <b>ten minutes</b>.

This free game is over two years old, and I guess it was supposed to serve as a demo for a fuller release?  But the "Episode 1" DLC still has a {{% abslink href="2018/01/21/early-access-late-release/" %}}release date{{% /abslink %}} of "2017 Q1" -- and the creator seems to have abandoned this idea in favor of an <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/739540/announcements/detail/1458464431500823759">ARG</a> that will lead up to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/739540/Break_the_Game/">a sequel</a>... maybe.

Well, good luck with all that!

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Toren>
