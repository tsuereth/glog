{{% game "Pepper's Puzzles" %}}Pepper's Puzzles{{% /game %}} sometimes feels like it's testing the boundaries of "<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">fair use</a>."

... that aside, it's a <i>hefty</i> picross game.  At 240 regular picture puzzles, and 184 more puzzles that form the larger "mosaics," it easily has more pre-baked puzzles than any picross game I've played before.

In terms of puzzle <i>size</i>, it falls a bit short of {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}}'s 40x30 figure -- maxing out at 35 tiles wide.  (The majority of its puzzles seem to be around 20x20 or so.)  And like many of its contemporaries, I'd bet that it <i>could</i> go bigger if only it had figured out a good "zoom" mechanic; i.e., puzzle size appears restricted mainly by the screen resolution.

It hurts a tiny bit that Pepper's Puzzles is Windows-only; I really would have liked to churn out some pictures on the couch, with my Powerbook.

Pepper has some cool things going for her: the time trials are a neat (though short-lived) feature, and a puzzle creator plus Steam Workshop integration is something I've {{% abslink href="2015/12/30/i-painted-it-all-back/" %}}previously referred to as "pretty dope."{{% /abslink %}}  ... but it still feels slightly inferior, to me, largely because of its maximum puzzle bounds.

As impressed as I was by how <i>many</i> puzzles Pepper threw at me, only one or two of its puzzles ever felt individually challenging (like Paint it Back's did).  And as <i>neat</i> as its new features are, they didn't have much of an impact on my gameplay experience (compared with {{% game "My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess" %}}Picrozelda{{% /game %}}'s number-grouping mechanic).

So I wouldn't call it a bar-raising picross package.  But, if you want an <i>absolute fuckload</i> of puzzles, Pepper's got you covered.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "InfiniPicross" %}}InfiniPicross{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Pok&eacute;mon Picross" %}}Pok&eacute;mon Picross{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess" %}}My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}}  
<b>That should probably be enough nonograms</b>: for the rest of 2018.
