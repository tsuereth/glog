{{% game "Oxenfree" %}}Oxenfree{{% /game %}} wasn't perfect, but it was thrilling and exceptionally memorable.  More than a year later, I still fondly recall its endearingly-anxious characters and "creepy-shit" (my words) storytelling.

Add a dash of <a href="http://nightschoolstudio.com/afterparty/">neon-backlit <i>hell</i></a>, and -- yeah, {{% game "Afterparty" %}}Afterparty{{% /game %}} looks like something I want to play.
