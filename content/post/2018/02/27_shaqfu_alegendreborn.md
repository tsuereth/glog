{{% abslink href="2018/01/21/early-access-late-release/" %}}Last month{{% /abslink %}}, I lamented the protracted development period of - among other Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects - {{% game "Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn" %}}Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn{{% /game %}}.  As if the {{% game "Shaq-Fu" %}}original game{{% /game %}} wasn't enough of a joke, this sequel project had claimed to be "99% there" <b>over a year ago</b>, before going silent.

Recently, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/shaq-fu-a-legend-reborn#/updates/all">a wild update appeared</a>, encouragingly titled: "Finally we are getting close to release!"

<blockquote>We wrote the game over three years ago and had not [sic] idea what history had in store for the world at that time. As a result, we had to change certain narratives because things got a little Nostradamus as the months unfolded. Some major plot changes meant we had to rework certain sections of the game that had a huge impact on the story overall.</blockquote>

I wonder if their story was about President Donald Trump killing Princess Leia.  I really hope that I can eventually see a making-of featurette about this "little Nostradamus" game that they'd intended to release.

Anyway -- so I guess this update means that Shaq Fu 2 finally has a release date!?

<blockquote>You can expect a new trailer and release date any day now.</blockquote>

Well, that hasn't happened yet.  Hell, maybe it'd be funnier if it doesn't happen.
