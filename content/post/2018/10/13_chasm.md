More than <b>five years</b> later, {{% game "Chasm" %}}Chasm{{% /game %}} finally got released.  It's technologically solid, and has a nice, clean art style.  That concludes the nice things I can say about it.

Chasm just isn't fun.

Combat, for starters, is somehow simple yet clunky.  Attacks are slow and can't be canceled - not by jumping, not by an evasive backward-dash - so most of the damage I suffered was well-telegraphed, but practically unavoidable.  Chasm abides by an <i>antiquated</i> combat design in which you must <a href="https://twitter.com/FolderBrad/status/1024841445105184769">jump, then attack</a> to preserve mobility -- not just silly and cumbersome, but impossible in some cramped corridors or over rough terrain.

Chasm has some elements of RPG progression, but doesn't execute them very well.  As you delve into the mine, you'll earn experience points from killing enemies, collect coin for purchasing upgrades, and gradually rescue townsfolk who can craft said upgrades.  But leveling up is slow, and grindy; collecting enough money for upgrades <i>also</i> feels grindy; and critically, <i>good</i> upgrades seem to be locked behind finding and rescuing the Blacksmith.  Until then, the only way to get better weapons or armor is random chance from enemy drops (which, again... feels grindy).

Some rescued townsfolk also prod along the game's underwhelming attempt at a story.  The light prologue, some collectible journal pages, and scant dialog all hint toward a backstory that's ... not very interesting.  Some legend about an old king and an apocalypse cult, and then -- <i>oh, you awakened an ancient evil in the mines?  You don't say.</i>

The game's world feels overall uncreative and empty.  The mine's levels are blatantly inspired by {{% game "Diablo" %}}Diablo{{% /game %}}, not only in how they change themes as you descend, but also in how they're procedurally assembled.  But while Diablo's randomly-arranged rooms showed "character" through the enemies you fought there, Chasm's enemies aren't that engaging, nor is anything else happening in its bland, interchangeable levels.

(There are a few environmental puzzles, but nothing comparable to, say, a {{% tag "The Legend of Zelda" %}}Zelda{{% /tag %}} block-pushing puzzle.)

Chasm wears its Diablo and {{% tag "Castlevania" %}}Castlevania{{% /tag %}} inspirations on its sleeve, but fails both to replicate the highlights of its predecessors, and to introduce any unique strengths of its own.  It's admirable, for a Kickstarted game, at being technically playable; but I couldn't give a good answer for <i>why</i> you would play it.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Bear Simulator" %}}Bear Simulator{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Torchlight" %}}Torchlight{{% /game %}}, or maybe even {{% game "SteamWorld Dig" %}}SteamWorld Dig{{% /game %}}  
<b>Arguably on-par with</b>: {{% game "Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn" %}}Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn{{% /game %}}

<i>Progress: Gave up in the catacombs.</i>
