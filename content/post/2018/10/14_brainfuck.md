As a programming-puzzle game featuring an obtuse language, {{% game "Brainfuck" %}}Brainfuck{{% /game %}} is <i>right</i> up my alley.  I bought this without a second thought.

So it was an extra-huge disappointment when I gave up on it and requested a refund.

I spent about 20 minutes in the game, and most of that was taking screenshots to demonstrate bugs I encountered.  They were all pretty heinous, but most importantly: none of the puzzle UI worked, meaning the game was totally unplayable.

I just expect games about programming to be, uh, well-programmed.  {{% tag "Zachtronics" %}}Zachtronics{{% /tag %}} really has spoiled me, hasn't it?
