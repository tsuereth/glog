Moments in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X2kIfS6fb8">this glorious trailer</a> remind me of {{% game "Watch Dogs" %}}Watch Dogs{{% /game %}} and of {{% game "Remember Me" %}}Remember Me{{% /game %}} -- of an alluring, and <i>specific</i> theme: the dirty, dingy side of humanity tethering itself to high technology.  Like {{% game "Deus Ex: Human Revolution" %}}Deus Ex HR{{% /game %}}/{{% game "Deus Ex: Mankind Divided" %}}MD{{% /game %}} but a little less clinical and clean.

It especially reminded me of Watch Dogs and Remember Me because <i>their</i> storytelling was pretty terrible.  CD Projekt should have no problems clearing that bar.  And if they can make {{% game "Cyberpunk 2077" %}}Cyberpunk{{% /game %}} as playable as {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}Witcher 3{{% /game %}} was, then I'll be more than happy spending dozens of hours, immersing myself in their world.
