Moments in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X2kIfS6fb8">this glorious trailer</a> remind me of <game:Watch Dogs> and of <game:Remember Me> -- of an alluring, and <i>specific</i> theme: the dirty, dingy side of humanity tethering itself to high technology.  Like [Deus Ex HR](game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution)/[MD](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) but a little less clinical and clean.

It especially reminded me of Watch Dogs and Remember Me because <i>their</i> storytelling was pretty terrible.  CD Projekt should have no problems clearing that bar.  And if they can make [Cyberpunk](game:Cyberpunk 2077) as playable as [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) was, then I'll be more than happy spending dozens of hours, immersing myself in their world.
