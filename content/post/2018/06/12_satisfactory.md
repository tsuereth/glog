I am surprised it took <i>this</i> long for someone to take advantage of <game:Factorio>'s extended development cycle.  But I suppose it's ... <game:Satisfactory>.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_lmP8jYVLs">The trailer</a> looks good, pretty much like I'd expect a 3D treatment of build-your-own-factory to.  (A little more elaborate than <game:Infinifactory>, since you can roam around in a buggy and there are indigenous lifeforms to beat up.)  And the <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/">FAQ</a> assuaged my fear that this would be a procedurally-generated, rogue-like, we-can't-be-bothered-to-QA-content operation:

> Are there multiple procedurally generated planets?
>
> No, there are no procedurally generated planets. Just one beautifully crafted, hand-made, 100% organic, vegan, GMO-free planet. Actually, it’s not even a whole planet. It’s just a small bit. But it’s still pretty big.

So, if the game can manage to be <i>stable</i> on release, maybe I'll finally get something like that factory-building game I've been looking forward to for [almost four years]($SiteBaseURL$2014/11/09/transforming-the-useless-pristine-land-into-a-marvel-of-smoggy-industry/).
