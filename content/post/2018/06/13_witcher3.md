One more aspect of {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}Witcher 3{{% /game %}} - actually, of the whole series - that I've been saving up praise for is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168339/">Geralt's voice actor</a>.

Most of the time, Geralt is a stubborn, cynical, sarcastic son of a bitch; and the delivery of his gravelly and wry lines is <i>perfect</i>.  He sounds like exactly who I'd want to hire to clear the rotfiends out of my yard.

But then there are occasions where Geralt goes out of character - particularly the Kaer Morhen drinking scene, and the wedding sequence in {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone" %}}Hearts of Stone{{% /game %}} - and these superb performances are some of the game's most memorable moments.  "Drunk Geralt" and "Happy-Possessed Geralt" shine brightly in their contrast to the White Wolf from the rest of the game.

That such a somber and depressing world can still be livened-up in these moments is a testament, both to CD Projekt's writing, and to their voice actors' performances.

I'll miss Geralt, and fondly remember his journeys on the Path.  160 hours later, I've finally exhausted my quest list -- and though I'm sure there's <i>even more</i> to do! because there are still so many white question marks on my map; it's time to move on.

<i>Progress: Level 54, all Gwent cards.</i>
