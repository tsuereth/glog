Seven years later, <game:Portal 2>'s campaign still holds up fairly well.

It did surprise me that it took so long before I got to Cave Johnson.  And that the Cave Johnson parts were over so quickly.  In my memory, this - wandering through the abandoned archives of Aperture - was the bulk of the game.

But in replaying it, the archives were actually a pretty minor segment, compared to all the stuff before (routine Portaling) and after (Wheatley's insane shit's-on-fire puzzles).  That other stuff is still fun, both in puzzle design and in humorous writing and voice acting; Cave Johnson is just so much of a show-stealer, that the rest of the game isn't as memorable.

Compared to the thrilling action-adventure jaunts of today, Portal 2 is a little on the short side (5-6 hours), and takes a little while to warm up.  But it's still perfectly enjoyable and worthwhile.

<b>Not as good as</b>: [The Witness](game:The Witness (2016))'s first-person puzzles, and <game:Borderlands 2>'s humor, both somewhat debatably.
