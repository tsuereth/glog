<game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter> has an uninspired title, is inexpensive, has "Mixed" reviews on Steam, and is from a publisher that seems to churn out puzzle games.  So, if it wasn't for the fact that I am a total sucker for picross, I never would have even bothered with it.

In fact, Nonogram has features that meet or <i>exceed</i> any other picross game I've played.  And I've played a bunch!  (As for the reviews, it seems like the game had issues at launch that have since been fixed.)

The main mode is a cool-looking "Gallery" of 126 puzzles: starting from the center image, completing each puzzle unlocks the adjacent images.  It almost feels like a choose-your-own-adventure campaign, albeit a short-lived one.  These puzzles go up to 25x25, which is pretty respectable, although a lot of them are only 5x5 or 10x10.

In addition to that mode, there's a menu of "Classic" puzzles, the <i>first</i> of which is <b>50x35</b>.  I am really excited to dig deeper into that mode.  And there's a Speed Drawing mode! like the Time Trials in <game:Pepper's Puzzles>, but <i>more</i> of them.  Plus a Steam Workshop mode that I probably won't bother with, but hey, well done guys.

Some picross games must limit their puzzle size based on screen layout -- very few offer any zoom at all, and if they do, it's only to pre-defined sizes.  Nonogram has an <i>adjustable</i> zoom, with scrollbars!  (You know, like any other PC application would have.)

Not only does it gray-out its numeric hints as you complete segments (take that, <game:Picross Fairytale>) but it even <i>highlights hints that are relevant</i>.  If a row is ready for a new mark or cross, the numbers will be highlighted, suggesting a place for your next move.  It doesn't make the game feel simpler or easier; just saves the time that I would otherwise spend tediously scanning each unfilled row and column.

And there's even a little <i>wit</i> in here, in the puzzle titles: some oblique pop-culture references, even some puns.  Whereas Pepper's Puzzles sometimes felt like they were just ripping off fan-art, Nonogram's titles make its references feel more like <i>knowing homages</i>.

... granted, the final images take some extreme artistic license, compared to the actual puzzles.  But I've got no problem with that.

Throw in a peaceful ambient soundtrack, and there's almost nothing wrong with Nonogram.  (The hint highlighting is occasionally inaccurate, thankfully on the side of under-helping rather than wrongly-hinting.)

For how humble it may appear, Nonogram is having no problem besting my previous favorite picross games.
