[Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone) doesn't change a whole lot about [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt).  The Runewright is cool in theory, but I never bothered actually using it (since I'm still replacing my equipment every few levels).  There are just a few side-quests, one or two new monsters?, and only a small handful of new Gwent cards.

What it <i>does</i> offer is a story.  A tale of mystery and intrigue, tragic heartbreak and sinister dealings, a wedding! a bank heist! and a magical alternate world.  It's a <i>tour de force</i> of the same storytelling chops that made the main game such a pleasure.  And its story content felt impressively varied; although I was a little let-down at how much of the heist was non-interactive -- overall, there simply wasn't a dull moment in this expansion's story quests.

So the fact that it doesn't do much else is totally fine, by me.  Excellent storytelling is just what I want out of The Witcher, and Hearts of Stone delivered.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dragonborn>, <game:Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: no, it's the best add-on story I've played so far.  
<b>That said</b>: my early hours in [Blood and Wine](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine) are pretty promising.
