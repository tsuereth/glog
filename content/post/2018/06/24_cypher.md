I play different puzzle games for different reasons.  Some, like a {{% game "Pepper's Puzzles" %}}picross game{{% /game %}}, are relaxing ways to unwind.  Some, like {{% game "Portal 2" %}}Portal 2{{% /game %}} or {{% game "Antichamber" %}}Antichamber{{% /game %}}, are fun to learn and explore -- as a journey of understanding the designers' ideas.  And some, like {{% game "SpaceChem" %}}SpaceChem{{% /game %}} or {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}}, humble me because they make me feel like a complete idiot.

{{% game "Cypher (2018)" %}}Cypher{{% /game %}} is in that last category.  It <i>really</i> makes me feel stupid.  And I love it.

Surprising, at least to me, considering {{% tag "Matthew Brown" %}}its developer{{% /tag %}} is known for small and relatively-simple puzzlers like {{% game "Hexcells" %}}Hexcells{{% /game %}}.  Cypher is a huge step up in terms of complexity: after spending a few hours with it, I legitimately believe that three-letter-agency cryptographers might respect these puzzles.  Forget about my praise for {{% game "Nonogram - The Greatest Painter" %}}Nonogram{{% /game %}}'s in-game hints -- Cypher is praiseworthy because <b>you need a pencil and paper</b> to work these guys out.

And it's a step up in production quality, too.  Strangely it still uses the default Unity taskbar icon... but the minimalist 3D world, and soft piano soundtrack, form a fantastically soothing library-like aesthetic around these hard-as-shit crypto puzzles.

{{% tag "Zachtronics" %}}Zach Barth{{% /tag %}} and {{% game "The Witness (2016)" %}}Jonathan Blow{{% /game %}} have a new peer in my esteem of puzzle-creators.
