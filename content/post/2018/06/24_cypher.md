I play different puzzle games for different reasons.  Some, like a [picross game](game:Pepper's Puzzles), are relaxing ways to unwind.  Some, like <game:Portal 2> or <game:Antichamber>, are fun to learn and explore -- as a journey of understanding the designers' ideas.  And some, like <game:SpaceChem> or <game:TIS-100>, humble me because they make me feel like a complete idiot.

[Cypher](game:Cypher (2018)) is in that last category.  It <i>really</i> makes me feel stupid.  And I love it.

Surprising, at least to me, considering [its developer](tag:Matthew Brown) is known for small and relatively-simple puzzlers like <game:Hexcells>.  Cypher is a huge step up in terms of complexity: after spending a few hours with it, I legitimately believe that three-letter-agency cryptographers might respect these puzzles.  Forget about my praise for [Nonogram](game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter)'s in-game hints -- Cypher is praiseworthy because <b>you need a pencil and paper</b> to work these guys out.

And it's a step up in production quality, too.  Strangely it still uses the default Unity taskbar icon... but the minimalist 3D world, and soft piano soundtrack, form a fantastically soothing library-like aesthetic around these hard-as-shit crypto puzzles.

[Zach Barth](tag:Zachtronics) and [Jonathan Blow](game:The Witness (2016)) have a new peer in my esteem of puzzle-creators.
