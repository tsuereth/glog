At its best, <game:CrossCells> feels like an inductive-reasoning "expansion pack" on puzzles like sudoku and picross.  Like the other 'Cells games, it incorporates multiple mathematical mechanics, and plays their hints off one another.  And as I worked through its later puzzles, I felt very satisfied with their logical <i>tightness</i>.

But while CrossCells is pretty satisfying when it "works," it just as often "doesn't."  Whether because I hadn't learned its rules adequately, or because the rules weren't applied rigorously enough - I couldn't say, in retrospect - many levels felt like I had to <b>guess</b> to move forward.  Only after following that guess for several steps would I know if I was on the right track.

CrossCells would really have benefited from a "try it out" system, like some picross games have, to follow a hypothesis for a while and then undo it if necessary.  But, let alone that -- CrossCells doesn't even have a "reset" function.  Its interface is as minimally-functional as can be.

(Made a bunch of wrong moves?  To reset the puzzle, you need to exit to the menu and click the puzzle again.  And the annoying water-ripple animations draw this process out to several seconds.  <i>Ugh.</i>)

CrossCells shows mechanical promise, but just isn't quite friendly and sophisticated enough (both in UI and in its difficulty-ramp) to be very noteworthy.  And it's pretty short, to boot.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Hexcells>, <game:SquareCells>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Hexcells Plus>, <game:Hexcells Infinite>  
<b>... but for a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632000/CrossCells/">sale price of under $1</a></b>: it's hard to go wrong.

<i>Progress: Finished all 50 puzzles.</i>
