I adapted to how <game:Hungry Cat Picross> has different rules than I'm used to -- a little reminiscent of <game:SquareCells>, but simpler.  And I could tolerate the fidgety UI, particularly how dragging to paint could also change the paint color, when dragging to the bottom of the screen.

But what I totally ran out of patience for was that some of these puzzles have <b>multiple solutions</b>.  Well, the <i>hints</i> have multiple solutions; only one of them is "right" for the puzzle.  There were a handful of times when the puzzle was telling me I was wrong, even though all the hints were satisfied correctly.

In other words, some puzzles can't be solved purely by logical deduction; they're only solvable by guessing.

That's a hard pass.
