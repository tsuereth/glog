I don't know if I'm getting this title right.  Steam calls it "<game:Picross Fairytale> - nonogram: Red Riding Hood Secret" which sounds like a poor translation from ... something.  And that fits with the general production value of the game.

That is, like it was ported from a mobile game, and not very well.

This is the only picross game I've played, so far, in which dragging the cursor over an already-filled square can <i>overwrite</i> that square.  Resulting in already-checked or already-crossed squares becoming easily mislabeled.  Considering picross games have been fairly widespread for some decades now, this feels like a rookie mistake.

And otherwise, the game has nothing special going for it.  The plot is threadbare, a minimalist reference to stories of princes and princesses; the level progression is straightforward and inflexible, pushing you from one level to the next with no surprises; and the interface is about as dumb as possible, with no graying-out of numeric hints when they're satisfied.  There is an awkward indicator when a row or column is "right," but since it doesn't take any other rows or columns into account, it's about as helpful as <i>looking at the squares yourself</i> would be.

And you can pay real money for some kind of currency.  I don't know what it does.  I can't imagine why, in a puzzle game, paying money to ... skip puzzles, I guess? ... would be even remotely okay.

Even considering that it's free, this isn't worth it.  You'd do better to shell out a few bucks for a picross game that isn't as outright <i>shitty</i>.
