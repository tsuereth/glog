[A Criminal Past](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - A Criminal Past) is both longer and more story-driven than [System Rift](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - System Rift) was.  But the execution of this DLC turns those could-be-positives into some slightly-negatives.

A Criminal Past is narratively framed as a story that Adam Jensen is telling to an Interpol psychologist, who is <a href="http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Delara_Auzenne">definitely a character</a> from [Mankind Divided](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) that I've totally forgotten about.  (A mark against the main game, for how un-memorable she was.)  A "present-day" conversation between her and Adam introduces the mission as a flashback; and at some plot moments during this mission, the two will provide narrative voiceovers to recap the story so far.

While I admire the ambition of this storytelling technique, its implementation just isn't that good.  The dialog between Delara and Jensen is generally dry and un-engaging.  And, if Adam dies during the mission, Delara will cut in with a "That's not what happened, try to remember" line -- much like <game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time> did, but in the serious and professional context of A Criminal Past's story, it sounds very out of place.

Writing for the mission's characters is similarly ambitious, but insufficient.  Key characters tend to lean on a single defining personality trait: Flossy is a dealmaker, the Fixer is neurotic.  Stenger, at least, shows some signs of character complexity as the story moves forward.  But other characters are too one-note to be believable or interesting.

Partially as a result of these flat characters, the back half of A Criminal Past comes across as stretched-out.

The first half is pretty exciting: Jensen is dropped into a fortress-style prison, and must figure out how to move around freely without being shot at.  Sure, it bears <i>some</i> resemblance to System Rift's bank vault, but the presence of other prisoners - especially when you're doing favors for them - and the architecture of the cell blocks and the outdoor "yard" area, have a very different feel.  I liked developing a familiarity with the cell blocks' maps as I snuck between them to carry out errands.

Remember how [I said]($SiteBaseURL$2018/12/29/augmented-bank-heist/) that System Rift streamlined itself by giving you a bunch of Praxis Points to start?  Well, A Criminal Past doesn't; you're reset back to a baseline Adam Jensen.  But I actually liked that restriction, here, because it helps encourage mechanics that are thematically appropriate for a prison break.  Like <i>hiding</i> from guard patrols, rather than always taking them out; and tracking down keycodes and computer passwords, instead of hacking them.

Unfortunately, the second half of A Criminal Past reverts to more familiar, rote scenarios.  Largely, getting past guards in otherwise-empty office floors, with no objectives other than navigating from one end to the other.  These later areas felt inappropriately sprawling, and while I typically like to methodically search a floor and collect everything in it, I skipped a few areas because I was ready for the game to be over.

At its worst, though, A Criminal Past is still "more Deus Ex."  And at its best, in the initial prison-break scenario, it ticks all the same boxes that I enjoyed in System Rift.

Despite its pacing problem, this is another worthy excuse to dive back into Deus Ex.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link>, at least as far as I can remember it.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - System Rift>, mostly because of the pacing.  
<b>Here's hoping that Deus Ex</b>: can come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-30-dont-expect-another-deus-ex-game-anytime-soon">out of "hiatus"</a> in one piece.
