Two years after I said that resetting talent points was {{% abslink href="2016/09/25/the-doldrums-of-deus-ex/" %}}"an instant turn-off"{{% /abslink %}} for DXMD's [System Rift](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - System Rift) DLC, I've gotten over it.  ... Well, I've also forgotten what most of those talents <i>were</i>, anyway.

Unlike the previous game's [The Missing Link](game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link) DLC, though, this one gives you a bunch of initial Praxis Points; so instead of starting out as a hobbled newbie, you get to build a moderately-powerful Adam Jenson from the beginning.  I definitely appreciate how this streamlined the introduction.

And I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was for me to get back into my Deus Ex "groove" -- before I knew it, I was sneaking into the map's nooks and crannies, finding hidden paths around security checkpoints, incapacitating hostile guards, and obsessively hacking every terminal and laptop I could find.  I guess it's a credit to the main game that my instincts came back so quickly.

After a few errands that set up the plot, the primary activity in System Rift is infiltrating a Palisade Blade installation (datacenter bank vault) for some cyber-espionage.  And this stealth op ticked most of my favorite boxes from [Mankind Divided](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided) itself: the aforementioned sneaking, hacking, et cetera.  I had a lot of fun finding my way around the bank's defenses, and reading all of their employees' email.

On the flip side, this DLC is kinda short, and - though there are a couple optional objectives inside the bank - doesn't have any side missions or other significant secrets to uncover.  While it does pack a meaningful amount of detail and choice into its single mission, it's still just a single mission.  I found myself missing the open-ness of Mankind Divided's world map, a bit.

But, as a side-story to the main game, System Rift is pretty engaging and satisfying.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone>  
<b>As big as Deus Ex is on player choice</b>: I have to assume that going into the bank <i>guns blazing</i> wouldn't have turned out very well.
