[Last time]($SiteBaseURL$2018/06/24/hidden-in-plain-sight/), I praised [Cypher](game:Cypher (2018))'s ability to make me feel like an idiot.  Now that I've looked up some of the solutions online, I feel like adding an important clarification.

When I fail to solve a puzzle due to outlandish leaps of logic - like collating binary bits into groups of <i>five?</i>, or arranging planetary symbols by the lengths of their days - that doesn't make me feel dumb.  It makes me feel ... nothing.  Or at worst, like I'm playing [Monkey Island 2](game:Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge).

Granted, there were some puzzles that I just hadn't applied myself hard enough to.  But most of the ones I "missed" had solutions that I'd never, in a million years, have figured out on my own.  And while I can <i>respect</i> the kind of "way outside the box" thinking that these puzzles were asking, that isn't something I look for in a solo game.

But I don't want to dwell on those puzzles too much.  The first 45-50% of the game was a blast to solve using only in-game guidance -- and, in the case of the Vigenere ciphers, a web-app for automating the rotations.  I felt really satisfied with this part of the game, and with Cypher's museum-like <i>ambience</i> along the way.

I'm still overall impressed, and excited for more from Matthew Brown.  ... like <game:Alchemia>, I suppose.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Sethian>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: given I can't think of a great comparison, <game:Human Resource Machine>  
<b>Actually</b>: I think the leaps-of-logic would have been more fun if this was a co-operative multiplayer activity.  I wonder if a [Jackbox](game:The Jackbox Party Pack)-style mobile UI for note-sharing collaboration would work for this kind of game...

<i>Progress: 064%, including some internet hints.</i>
