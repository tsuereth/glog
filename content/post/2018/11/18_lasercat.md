<game:LaserCat> is a fairly basic, fairly short platform-based Metroidvania-ish with a fun sense of humor, and a surprising amount of <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i> references.

There's no combat, just avoiding enemies and environmental hazards (lava); and there are no puzzles, aside from a couple of rooms where you need to approach from the right direction.  No upgrades, no experience points, no cinematic cutscenes.  The story is only told in some introductory text, then an ending.

There really isn't much to LaserCat except jumping and exploring the map.  But that exploration is pretty engaging; not just for its own sake, but also for the sake of discovering joke-y room names and signposts.

LaserCat is simple, but has enough substance to more than justify its 90-minute running length.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:1000 Amps>, albeit significantly shorter.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:VVVVVV>  
<b>Better trivia questions than</b>: <game:Yooka-Laylee>

<i>Progress: 100%</i>
