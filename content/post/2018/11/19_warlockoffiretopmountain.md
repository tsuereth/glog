I was really hoping that <game:The Warlock of Firetop Mountain> would be a more dragon-flavored [Thronebreaker](game:Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales).  Not really.

Complain as I did about Thronebreaker's lack of compelling characters, at least its story was engaging and well-told.  Warlock is more like, well, <i>reading a game book</i>.  No voice acting, no free-form exploration, limited animations - made to resemble a tabletop game, rather than a fantasy world - and random, bullshit events that would feel right at home in a hackneyed choose-your-own-adventure book.

The combat system includes some tactical quirks that <i>might</i> be interesting, if I really cared about the outcome.  That is, hypothetically, trying to predict enemy movements and evading or attacking tactically; these would be exciting if I felt any attachment to the story, or if it seemed like I was actually building up my character.  (Are there experience points?  It doesn't seem like there are.)

I reached the end of my rope when I fought some monsters, survived, then got whisked away to a scripted event that killed me and put me back to a checkpoint <i>before the monsters</i>.  Ugh.

In terms of content and mechanics, I think there's some worthwhile stuff here (aside from the punishing checkpoint system).  But the production values, from the chintzy-looking character minis to the boring storytelling, leave me uninterested in delving further into Firetop Mountain.

To be fair, ordering my character to certain death in an orc den <i>could be</i> a ton of fun if I was doing it while drinking with my friends.

<i>Progress: Like 20 minutes in.</i>
