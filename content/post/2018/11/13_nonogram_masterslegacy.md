Hey look, it's a free-to-play picross game, yeah I'm up for th-- oh... this is <i>exactly the same game</i> as <game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter>.

On the one hand, <game:Nonogram: Master's Legacy> presents a neat puzzle-delivery model.  After an introductory Starter Pack, collections of puzzles can be purchased separately (<i>a la carte!</i>).  Meanwhile, access to a puzzle editor - and puzzles built by the community, using said editor - remains free.

On the other hand: the free Starter Pack only has 15 puzzles, and the largest one is only 9x9; most are 5x5 or smaller.  Hell, it starts with a few <b>2x2</b> puzzles!  This is a pretty lacking introduction to picross for a new user.  And for someone who's already played The Greatest Painter... well, as far as I can tell, the DLC for this game is just the same puzzles.  Why would I buy them again?

Meanwhile, from browsing both games' update histories, the developer doesn't appear to have addressed the [technical issues I ran into]($SiteBaseURL$2018/07/23/fall-from-greatest/) with large, meaty puzzles.

Master's Legacy is a cool idea for building Nonograms As A Service, but this execution of it is unconvincing.  Engine technology aside, they simply need <i>more puzzles</i> - both in the free base game, and in additional DLC packs - to prove that they're capable of more than re-releasing the same game over again.
