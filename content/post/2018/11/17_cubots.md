The trailer for {{% game "Cubots: The Origins" %}}Cubots{{% /game %}} looked so clean and polished, I was kinda surprised at how inexpensive the game is.  Well... you get what you pay for.

Specifically, what I paid for here turned out to be pretty much garbage.  Setting aside the lack of controller support, the slapdash UI (you can elect to jump to a boss fight?), the broken English in tutorial text, and the assets that look like they came out of a free art pack...

This is a puzzle game, where you're a block, and you push other blocks around.  Yet movement is <b>not grid-aligned</b>!  <i>Physics</i> is the last thing I'd expect to worry about in a block-pushing puzzle, but here we are, in a world where terrain collision and laser avoidance have to be pixel-perfect for no good reason.

I also somehow broke the UI when I tried exiting the game.  The sequence of buttons I clicked resulted in the game being soft-locked.  <i>Yikes.</i>

For a hobby project, Cubots isn't bad -- but for a product, it's just trash.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Legends of Persia" %}}Legends of Persia{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Finding Teddy" %}}Finding Teddy{{% /game %}}  
<b>I really had to go looking</b>: to find past games I rated "Awful" that are comparable.

<i>Progress: Finished a few puzzles.</i>
