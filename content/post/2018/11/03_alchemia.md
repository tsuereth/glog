When I saw <game:Alchemia> pop up on Steam, I thought it might be a nice break from the brain-busting puzzles I was stuck on in [Cypher](game:Cypher (2018)).

Hahaha.  Hah.  Hahah.

Cypher's later puzzles don't tell you what the rules are; you're supposed to take the techniques you've learned so far, and think creatively about how they might apply.  Alchemia <i>starts</i> there.

Even the structure of Alchemia isn't obvious at first, although I think I got that figured out.

What's really exciting about its puzzles is how they tie into out-of-game references -- or, to put it another way, how much weird detective-work I'm doing through Google searches.  All of the puzzles have at least some tie-in to the "alchemy" theme, and most involve researching topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> or the location of Atlantis.  It's clear that a whole ton of work went into planning out the game.

At the same time, the implementation quality is pretty cheap and simple.  I'd kill for basic quality-of-life improvements like the ability to write notes in-game, or to copy the game's text for easier pasting into a search engine.

It's been hard for me to make progress in Alchemia, or even to know <i>if</i> I'm making progress.  But it's the kind of challenge I really like getting lost in.

<i>Progress: ???</i>
