Given it's been over a decade since I played <game:Zone of the Enders>, I was surprised at how <i>distinctly</i> the demo of <game:Zone of The Enders: The 2nd Runner Mars> reminded me of the original.

At first, I'd mistakenly believed that this sequel was brand new -- but, no, it's a remaster of a <platform:PS2> game from 2003.  And through that lens, the game's apparent shortcomings make a lot more sense.

To be fair: the remaster looks great, with crisp models and silky-smooth effects.  And, admirably, the control scheme still holds up fairly well.

But in the limited demo for 2nd Runner, I could already tell that it re-checks all the bad boxes {{% abslink href="2007/06/28/zone-of-the-enders-4/" %}}I wrote about the original{{% /abslink %}}:

* "Camera movement is basically impossible?"  Check.
* "Pretty much [only] two enemies?"  Check.
* "Lengthy dialog sessions" with "insipid banter?"  Check.
* "Terrible" voice acting?  Check.

Even within the span of the demo, I was already waiting for it to end.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
