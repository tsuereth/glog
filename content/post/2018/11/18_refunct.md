<game:Refunct> is a neat little experiment in first-person parkour gaming.  It does a cool job of organically introducing core mechanics - <i>how do I climb this tower? better jump around randomly until I discover the wall-jump</i> - and it has a clean, simple aesthetic.

And it's easy to complete in half an hour or less.  (There's an achievement for completing the game in under 4 minutes.)

Neat, but hard to recommend for purchase, at any price.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Cubots: The Origins>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:AER: Memories of Old>  
<b>But, kudos to the developer</b>: for making a pretty good portfolio piece.
