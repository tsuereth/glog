I briefly mentioned, [last time]($SiteBaseURL$2018/05/27/fookin-skelligers/), that [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) still has a few kinks in it.  Take this scene, in which some unfortunate Nilfgaardian soldiers find themselves trapped in a pathfinding black hole:

The last few story missions were definitely a bit <i>weird</i>, but ultimately everything resolved in a really satisfying and fun-to-watch way.  And yet, as much as I could go on about the fulfilling send-off, and the pathos of seeing my choices impact Geralt's story, and the intrigue of how things might have turned out differently...

I'd rather jump right back in.  There are still plenty of sidequests to investigate, contracts to chase, and treasure hunts to track down.  (Not to mention the [Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone) story!)

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild>, in terms of mechanical fun.  
<b>... but</b>: <i>absolutely</i> better than Breath of the Wild in terms of narrative interest, character development, and world engagement.
