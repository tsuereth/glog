Well, did [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)'s new-gen patch resolve its [clunky controls]($SiteBaseURL$2022/12/16/oh-valley-of-plenty-ah-ah-aaaaah/)?  <i>Is</i> its slight amount of new content worthwhile?  Does it breathe new life into the gradually-aging masterpiece?

... not really, I guess, and it didn't exactly need to.

Some minor quality-of-life improvements like <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Quick_Sign_Casting">quick-cast</a> and <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/witcher-3-ps5-update-gameplay-changes">herb auto-looting</a> are nice, but Geralt still maneuvers like a sword-wielding RV.

The new "<a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Wolf_School_Gear">Netflix armor</a>" quest, <i><a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/In_the_Eternal_Fire%27s_Shadow">In the Eternal Fire's Shadow</a></i>, is a meaty side-story and includes some solid writing -- but it's still just one sidequest.

And Witcher 3 on <platform:PC> already looked great, at least to me, despite its apparent lack of <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_4.0_(The_Witcher_3)#PC_and_Next-Gen_Exclusives">ray-tracing and 4K faces and <i>et cetera</i></a>.

(The less said about <a href="https://primagames.com/tips/how-to-get-the-netflix-alternative-dandelion-appearance-in-witcher-3">Dandelion's new look</a>, the better.)

But, see, Witcher 3 didn't <i>need</i> an update to make it worth replaying.  And nowhere is this more evident than Toussaint, where the [Blood and Wine](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine) expansion doesn't <i>just</i> paint a beautiful rural-urban-hybrid landscape with the same kind of deeply enthralling content as the main game.

It also adds <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Knight_for_Hire">narratively-relevant Knight Errant missions</a>.  And expanded, super-powerful <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Mutations_(Blood_and_Wine)">skill mutations</a>.  And a <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Corvo_Bianco">homestead</a> which you can decorate with <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Witcher_as_an_Old_Man">fine art</a>.

Blood and Wine may not have the invading-Empire, transdimensional-magic stakes of the main game -- but it otherwise encapsulates all the best that Witcher 3 has to offer, in an irresistably beautiful virtual France.

(Even if I do feel like Blood and Wine's ending-related choices are <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Sylvia_Anna#Returning_Home">unnecessarily obtuse</a>, and going back to try different choices comes with a disappointing amount of <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Night_of_Long_Fangs">replaying lengthy mission content</a>.)

Well worth replaying.  Heck, depending on how the <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development">first game's remake</a> is going, I might be back again in a few years.

<i>Progress: Finished all the Blood and Wine quests I could find.</i>
