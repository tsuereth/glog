Steam launched a year-in-review feature called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay">Replay</a> -- it's pretty cool!  And its gray "other games" bars highlight a certain pattern in my 2022 gaming:

<table><tr><td>
{{% absimg src="2022_steamreplay-count.png" width="200" height="127" %}}
</td><td>
{{% absimg src="2022_steamreplay-timeline.png" width="586" height="251" %}}
</td></tr></table>

As does comparing Steam's counters with Glog statistics:

{{< chart type="ColumnChart" datafile="/data/postsandgames_2022.json" title="Posts and Games" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" >}}

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/demosandreplays_2022.json" title="Games Demoed and Replayed" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

<i>Where did all those Steam games and demos go?</i>  Well, <b>nowhere</b>.

Building on my "{{% abslink href="2022/01/01/2021-in-review-not-dead-yet/" %}}less writing, more playing{{% /abslink %}}" agenda from 2021, I <i>culled</i> a considerable amount of my backlog last year, focusing my playtime and my Glog posts on fewer and more-remarkable games (as the Steam timeline's colored-in segments show).

As for those replays: I dug up [Assassin's Creed IV](game:Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag) after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11000902/">Our Flag Means Death</a>, and <tag:The Witcher>'s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/">TV series</a> has had me jonesing to revisit [Wild Hunt](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) (plus [Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone)) since my {{% abslink href="2020/01/01/2019-in-review-less-isnt-more/" %}}2019 recap{{% /abslink %}}.  <i>Media consumption!</i>  Am I right?

... anyway.  My DLC and expansion activity in 2022 tells a similar story:

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/gametypes_2022.json" title="Games by Type" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

While it'd be hard to beat the <i>quantity</i> of DLCs (especially <tag:Mass Effect>'s) I played in 2021, last year's <i>quality</i> of add-ons was surprisingly solid.

* <game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole>'s extra chapters [From Dusk Till Casa Bonita](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - From Dusk Till Casa Bonita) and [Bring the Crunch](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - Bring the Crunch) both did great at channeling that classic <i>South Park</i> sense of humor, while experimenting with some passably-fun gameplay twists.
* <game:Control>'s comprehensive, unsettling yet entertaining tone (and its tense shooting-supernatural-monsters action) carried through into very substantial side-stories in [The Foundation](game:Control: The Foundation) and [AWE](game:Control: AWE).
* And of course, it cannot be overstated how essential [Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone) is to the whole Geralt experience.

These add-ons were <i>good</i>, just like the main games I played last year.  I mean, check out these rating values:

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/ratings_2022.json" title="Ratings" colors="[\"gray\", \"red\", \"orange\", \"gold\", \"green\", \"blue\"]" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

Here, summarily, is the glorious result of my ruthless backlog management.  A <i>majority</i> - more than half! - of my post ratings were positive, for the first time since 2015 (which was itself a {{% abslink href="2016/01/01/2015-a-shameful-embarrassment-of-statistical-failure/" %}}statistical aberration{{% /abslink %}}).

I played a satisfying amount of <rating:Awesome> games, with the expectedly-impressive <game:Horizon Forbidden West>, the unexpectedly endearing <game:Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy>, the shockingly compelling <game:Control> + [The Foundation](game:Control: The Foundation) + [AWE](game:Control: AWE), and a comfortably enthralling return to <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt> + [Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone).

And I got a healthy serving of <rating:Good>, highlights including the fun and funny [South Park games](tag:South Park), the action-packed time-hopping <game:Deathloop>, the science-fantasy time-bopping <game:Outer Wilds>, and the ... Shakespearean time-skipping <game:Elsinore>.

<i>(Plus [Omensight](game:Omensight: Definitive Edition) and <game:The Forgotten City>; I hadn't planned on getting stuck in so many time loops!  Call that another of my niches, I guess, along with [nonograms](game:Piczle Cross Adventure) and [programming puzzles](tag:Zachtronics).)</i>

2022 only held a few, mild disappointments, like the over-extended <game:Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order> (<rating:Meh>), the genre-confused <game:Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials> (Meh), and the terminally dull <game:Evoland 2> (<rating:Bad>).

So what's next?

Some pretty exciting franchise entries and sequels are targeting 2023, like <game:Hollow Knight: Silksong>, <game:The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom>, and <game:Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League>.  But <i>all</i> of these games have histories with release dates that ... well, I'm not holding my breath.

<game:God of War RagnarÃ¶k> will almost certainly be the swan song of my <platform:PS4>, since the [upcoming Horizon Forbidden West DLC](game:Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores) is apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-dlc-announced-exclusive-to-ps5">skipping it</a>.

Although my backlog has thinned out, I've got positive expectations for its remainders, especially <game:Cyberpunk 2077>, <game:Disco Elysium>, and <game:The Outer Worlds>.

But for now, I'm already in the thick of <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine>.  And I still need to finish investigating <game:Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye> -- more on that, uh, eventually.
