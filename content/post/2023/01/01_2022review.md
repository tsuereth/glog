Steam launched a year-in-review feature called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay">Replay</a> -- it's pretty cool!  And its gray "other games" bars highlight a certain pattern in my 2022 gaming:

<table><tr><td>
{{% absimg src="2022_steamreplay-count.png" width="200" height="127" %}}
</td><td>
{{% absimg src="2022_steamreplay-timeline.png" width="586" height="251" %}}
</td></tr></table>

As does comparing Steam's counters with Glog statistics:

{{< chart type="ColumnChart" datafile="/data/postsandgames_2022.json" title="Posts and Games" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" >}}

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/demosandreplays_2022.json" title="Games Demoed and Replayed" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

<i>Where did all those Steam games and demos go?</i>  Well, <b>nowhere</b>.

Building on my "{{% abslink href="2022/01/01/2021-in-review-not-dead-yet/" %}}less writing, more playing{{% /abslink %}}" agenda from 2021, I <i>culled</i> a considerable amount of my backlog last year, focusing my playtime and my Glog posts on fewer and more-remarkable games (as the Steam timeline's colored-in segments show).

As for those replays: I dug up {{% game "Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag" %}}Assassin's Creed IV{{% /game %}} after watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11000902/">Our Flag Means Death</a>, and {{% tag "The Witcher" %}}The Witcher{{% /tag %}}'s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5180504/">TV series</a> has had me jonesing to revisit {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}Wild Hunt{{% /game %}} (plus {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone" %}}Hearts of Stone{{% /game %}}) since my {{% abslink href="2020/01/01/2019-in-review-less-isnt-more/" %}}2019 recap{{% /abslink %}}.  <i>Media consumption!</i>  Am I right?

... anyway.  My DLC and expansion activity in 2022 tells a similar story:

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/gametypes_2022.json" title="Games by Type" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

While it'd be hard to beat the <i>quantity</i> of DLCs (especially {{% tag "Mass Effect" %}}Mass Effect{{% /tag %}}'s) I played in 2021, last year's <i>quality</i> of add-ons was surprisingly solid.

<ul>
<li>{{% game "South Park: The Fractured But Whole" %}}South Park: The Fractured But Whole{{% /game %}}'s extra chapters {{% game "South Park: The Fractured But Whole - From Dusk Till Casa Bonita" %}}From Dusk Till Casa Bonita{{% /game %}} and {{% game "South Park: The Fractured But Whole - Bring The Crunch" %}}Bring The Crunch{{% /game %}} both did great at channeling that classic <i>South Park</i> sense of humor, while experimenting with some passably-fun gameplay twists.</li>
<li>{{% game "Control" %}}Control{{% /game %}}'s comprehensive, unsettling yet entertaining tone (and its tense shooting-supernatural-monsters action) carried through into very substantial side-stories in {{% game "Control: The Foundation" %}}The Foundation{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Control: AWE" %}}AWE{{% /game %}}.</li>
<li>And of course, it cannot be overstated how essential {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone" %}}Hearts of Stone{{% /game %}} is to the whole Geralt experience.</li>
</ul>

These add-ons were <i>good</i>, just like the main games I played last year.  I mean, check out these rating values:

{{< chart type="AreaChart" datafile="/data/ratings_2022.json" title="Ratings" colors="[\"gray\", \"red\", \"orange\", \"gold\", \"green\", \"blue\"]" legend="{\"position\": \"bottom\"}" isStacked="percent" pointSize="5" focusTarget="category" >}}

Here, summarily, is the glorious result of my ruthless backlog management.  A <i>majority</i> - more than half! - of my post ratings were positive, for the first time since 2015 (which was itself a {{% abslink href="2016/01/01/2015-a-shameful-embarrassment-of-statistical-failure/" %}}statistical aberration{{% /abslink %}}).

I played a satisfying amount of {{% rating "Awesome" %}}Awesome{{% /rating %}} games, with the expectedly-impressive {{% game "Horizon Forbidden West" %}}Horizon Forbidden West{{% /game %}}, the unexpectedly endearing {{% game "Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy" %}}Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy{{% /game %}}, the shockingly compelling {{% game "Control" %}}Control{{% /game %}} + {{% game "Control: The Foundation" %}}The Foundation{{% /game %}} + {{% game "Control: AWE" %}}AWE{{% /game %}}, and a comfortably enthralling return to {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt{{% /game %}} + {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone" %}}Hearts of Stone{{% /game %}}.

And I got a healthy serving of {{% rating "Good" %}}Good{{% /rating %}}, highlights including the fun and funny {{% tag "South Park" %}}South Park games{{% /tag %}}, the action-packed time-hopping {{% game "Deathloop" %}}Deathloop{{% /game %}}, the science-fantasy time-bopping {{% game "Outer Wilds" %}}Outer Wilds{{% /game %}}, and the ... Shakespearean time-skipping {{% game "Elsinore" %}}Elsinore{{% /game %}}.

<i>(Plus {{% game "Omensight: Definitive Edition" %}}Omensight{{% /game %}} and {{% game "The Forgotten City" %}}The Forgotten City{{% /game %}}; I hadn't planned on getting stuck in so many time loops!  Call that another of my niches, I guess, along with {{% game "Piczle Cross Adventure" %}}nonograms{{% /game %}} and {{% tag "Zachtronics" %}}programming puzzles{{% /tag %}}.)</i>

2022 only held a few, mild disappointments, like the over-extended {{% game "Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order" %}}Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order{{% /game %}} ({{% rating "Meh" %}}Meh{{% /rating %}}), the genre-confused {{% game "Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials" %}}Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials{{% /game %}} (Meh), and the terminally dull {{% game "Evoland 2" %}}Evoland 2{{% /game %}} ({{% rating "Bad" %}}Bad{{% /rating %}}).

So what's next?

Some pretty exciting franchise entries and sequels are targeting 2023, like {{% game "Hollow Knight: Silksong" %}}Hollow Knight: Silksong{{% /game %}}, {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" %}}The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom{{% /game %}}, and {{% game "Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League" %}}Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League{{% /game %}}.  But <i>all</i> of these games have histories with release dates that ... well, I'm not holding my breath.

{{% game "God of War: Ragnarok" %}}God of War: Ragnarok{{% /game %}} will almost certainly be the swan song of my {{% platform "PS4" %}}PS4{{% /platform %}}, since the {{% game "Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores" %}}upcoming Horizon Forbidden West DLC{{% /game %}} is apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-dlc-announced-exclusive-to-ps5">skipping it</a>.

Although my backlog has thinned out, I've got positive expectations for its remainders, especially {{% game "Cyberpunk 2077" %}}Cyberpunk 2077{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Disco Elysium" %}}Disco Elysium{{% /game %}}, and {{% game "The Outer Worlds" %}}The Outer Worlds{{% /game %}}.

But for now, I'm already in the thick of {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine" %}}The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine{{% /game %}}.  And I still need to finish investigating {{% game "Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye" %}}Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye{{% /game %}} -- more on that, uh, eventually.
