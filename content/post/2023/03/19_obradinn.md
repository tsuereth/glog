Given my <i>inexhaustible disdain</i> for the simulated data-entry tedium of {{% game "Papers, Please" %}}Papers, Please{{% /game %}}, I was relieved to see {{% game "Return of the Obra Dinn" %}}Return of the Obra Dinn{{% /game %}} de-emphasizing those pointless-feeling points and clicks in favor of a <b>mystery</b>, and an overt objective to collect clues and solve that mystery.

Three hours later... who the hell <i>are</i> these 51 dead sailors?  Or, more to the point -- why are my <i>automatic notebook</i> and <i>magic moment-of-death-vision pocketwatch</i> so awful at helping me solve this?

The confounding user interface - like {{% game "Inside (2016)" %}}Inside{{% /game %}}, allergic to the idea of <i>explaining itself</i> - would be bad enough.  But what I didn't realize about Obra Dinn's hint-collection system, until after collecting them <i>all</i>, was how <i>unhelpful</i> it is correlating post-facto notes with the relevant moment-of-death context.

To put it another way: as you discover death events around the Obra Dinn, recognizing the parties in that event <i>almost always</i> requires more knowledge than you have; and then later, once you've collected more knowledge, it's <i>unreasonably inconvenient</i> to go find and re-observe those events to recover their full context.

(What I wouldn't give for {{% game "Her Story" %}}Her Story{{% /game %}}-style video clip searches, instead of this go-find-a-corpse-on-a-ship nonsense.)

Ultimately, most of Obra Dinn's dot-connections are only possible if you're <b>taking your own meticulous notes</b> while the magic pocketwatch is revealing clues.  Because the best the in-game notebook will do is list the locations of dead bodies that you can <i>walk to</i> and then re-watch a correlated event.

Why even <i>have</i> an in-game notebook with such incomplete notes?

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Papers, Please" %}}Papers, Please{{% /game %}} cause I at least got to <i>watch</i> an interesting story play out.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Gone Home" %}}Gone Home{{% /game %}}  
<b>Comparable to</b>: {{% game "Kentucky Route Zero" %}}Kentucky Route Zero{{% /game %}}, because its intriguing premise was ultimately un-parseable and unsatisfying.

<i>Progress: Ended the investigation with 6 of 51 fates solved.</i>
