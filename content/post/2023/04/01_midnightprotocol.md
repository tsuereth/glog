As seen in [2020's demo]($SiteBaseURL$2020/06/21/its-a-unix-system-i-know-this/), I really like <game:Midnight Protocol>'s slick aesthetics, engrossing technobabble, and immersive keyboard-only interface.

I <i>do not</i> like its dice-roll intrusion traces, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162700/view/4625752147823635355">anti-save-scum randomizations</a>, and other chance-based twists.

It's awkward how most of Midnight Protocol's mechanics lean into careful, puzzle-like planning -- but unlucky rolls can ruin your plan and stick you in an unwinnable state.

I didn't even get far enough in the story to unlock any hardware upgrade options.  ... like, I might have done some <i>currency grinding</i> to out-level the game's randomness, if it had given me the opportunity.
