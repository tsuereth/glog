So yeah, I've been putting off revisiting - let alone posting about - <game:Outer Wilds> DLC [Echoes of the Eye](game:Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye) for quite a while.

Not because it feels unnecessary or tacked-onto the main game's trippy space mystery; I mean, Outer Wilds was just fine on its own, but the Eye's story integrates itself really well!  And not because its new gameplay is a disappointment, although, <i>it is</i>; the spooky segments which earn this DLC's "Horror" tag are more off-putting than the annoying <a href="https://outerwilds.fandom.com/wiki/Anglerfish">anglerfish</a> were.

But that's not why I've been sleeping on Echoes of the Eye -- my first forays into it, last year, didn't even reach those spooky parts.  No, I've been reluctant to return because this DLC is chock-full of the exact "obtuse points" that only occasionally [marred my Outer Wilds playthrough]($SiteBaseURL$2022/07/24/spaceloop/).

Dense locations that make specific points-of-interest difficult to locate; timed events that add unexpected schedule constraints to an objective; non-obvious order-of-operations requirements that mean a small mix-up may force you to restart the loop.  Echoes of the Eye mashes all of these frustrations together, and even <i>with</i> internet guidance, the new map's navigation challenges and time-sensitive elements make it ... <i>not fun</i> to explore and investigate.

It's a shame that this DLC's fascinating story, which manages to feel fresh while also pairing excellently with the existing lore, is something I only know because I <a href="https://outerwilds.fandom.com/wiki/The_Stranger%27s_inhabitants">read about it online</a>.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Fallout 4: Nuka World>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Fallout 4: Far Harbor>, <game:Outer Wilds>  
<b>Proposed spinoffs, just to troll on <game:The Outer Worlds></b>: "Outer Words," a space exploration game where ancient ruins are locked by crossword puzzles; "Outer Swirls," a space exploration game with art styled after Picasso's <i>The Starry Night</i>; "Shouter Worlds," a space exploration game guided by NPCs rage-yelling on radio broadcasts.  I've got more, guys.

<i>Progress: gave up!</i>
