I can only really recommend {{% game "Cyberpunk 2077" %}}Cyberpunk 2077{{% /game %}} with a significant qualification -- even if you're addicted to open-world RPGs, even if you're a huge fan of the dystopian sci-fi theme, and even if you absolutely loved {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}Witcher 3{{% /game %}}.  You need to be feeling <i>charitable</i> toward {{% tag "CD Projekt RED" %}}CD Projekt RED{{% /tag %}}; you need to be willing to tolerate some boredom, some befuddlement, and some bugs (yes, still!), inbetween the "good parts."

There <b>are</b> good parts: mechanics that're functional and fun, missions that tell memorable stories, character interactions that feel real and engaging.  But there are also plenty of lulls, and misses, and outright mistakes.  There's a lot of material for me to complain about.

Let's start with the positives, though.

Braindances!  Or, "{{% game "Remember Me" %}}Remember Me{{% /game %}} but better."  Cyberpunk deserves kudos for pulling off a usable memory-playback interface, and for putting together investigative sequences that Geralt and {{% tag "Batman: Arkham" %}}Batman{{% /tag %}} would feel at-home in.  Its sensory layer-switching is sadly underutilized - I can only remember one case that used the thermal layer - but I'd have loved to play more of these.

Quickhacks!  While Cyberpunk's combat can be approached from multiple angles, its aim-and-hack angle is definitely the most satisfying.  Quickhack abilities take the networked-camera hopping of {{% game "Watch Dogs" %}}Watch Dogs{{% /game %}} and crank it up to 11, because - since everyone has cyber-implants - you can reset an enemy's vision, short out their weapons, even <i>set their equipment on fire</i>.  Wreaking absolute havoc from a distance is a <i>delight</i>.  I'm also a fan of the {{% tag "Shadowrun" %}}Shadowrun{{% /tag %}}-style deck upgrades and software management meta-game.

And ... <i>some</i> sidequests!  A handful of Cyberpunk's optional stories are genuinely compelling, explore tough topics and dark themes through relatable characters, and demonstrate writing strengths commensurate with CD Projekt's resume.

There's a "but" hidden in that last paragraph, which leads me to -- well, hang on, let me <i>zoom out</i> first.

Cyberpunk's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/style/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-disaster.html">subpar release</a> is no secret, and its <a href="https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-annoymous-development-trouble-report/">troubled production</a> is well-documented.  It took over a year of updates to reach "playable" status on <a href="https://www.gameindustry.com/reviews/game-review/cyberpunk-2077-finally-drives-good-on-last-generation-consoles/">consoles targeted at launch</a>.

It's still <b>very unfinished</b>.  Today, in 2023.

I don't just mean that the game is technologically rough, <i>although it is</i>, with enough cosmetic glitches (models getting stuck in walls and floors) and game-logic defects (dialog playing on top of other dialog) and UI soft-locks (computer buttons turning invisible) that it's impossible to get through the game without experiencing them multiple times.

And I don't just mean that there are objectively unpolished design choices, <i>although there are</i>, like Reload and Replace Current Gun being the same key! and menu lists being ordered totally at-random (plus there are two categories of Shard titled "Other") and gun info-cards omitting crucial information like <b>accuracy</b>.

Nor do I just mean that there are lots of obvious seams where cut content would have gone, <i>and boy are there</i>, nowhere more plainly than when the prologue bridges the gap between your chosen origin, and your first mercenary mission, with a <i>cutscene montage</i>.

Night City is full of environments with no point, and NPCs with no purpose.  Open-world combat encounters are utterly shallow, yielding no meaning or reward beyond experience points.  Most missions feel unfocused and un-impactful, because their stories aren't fully here -- some vital events even occur "off-screen."  There are too many perk-upgrade options to <i>understand</i> in one playthrough, let alone attempt to use.  <b>Driving sucks</b>.

Another two years, another <i>eight</i> years of active development, still wouldn't be enough to "finish" Cyberpunk 2077.  It tried to do too many things, more than any game could ever accomplish.

But I think I can understand why Cyberpunk avoided cutting its scope, too: a smaller Night City would have lessened the city's thematically-critical power to impose and isolate you within it.

It's a shame that Cyberpunk 2077's impossible ambition prevented it from telling a complete story.  Like I said, though, if you're willing to give the game enough chances - clicking through its less-interesting content, on your way to the good parts - there are some worthwhile experiences in it.

And unlike {{% game "Red Dead Redemption 2" %}}Arthur Morgan's over-ambitious story{{% /game %}}, at least I could tackle this one at my own pace.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Fallout 4" %}}Fallout 4{{% /game %}}, {{% game "The Outer Worlds" %}}The Outer Worlds{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Red Dead Redemption 2" %}}Red Dead Redemption 2{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Watch Dogs" %}}Watch Dogs{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Batman: Arkham Knight{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Deus Ex: Human Revolution" %}}Deus Ex: Human Revolution{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Grand Theft Auto V" %}}Grand Theft Auto V{{% /game %}}, {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt{{% /game %}}  
<b>So, about that upcoming {{% game "Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" %}}Phantom Liberty{{% /game %}} expansion</b>: <I>we'll see</i>.
