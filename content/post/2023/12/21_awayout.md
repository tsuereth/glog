<game:A Way Out>, the game that <tag:Hazelight Studios> made before <game:It Takes Two>, is similar but not as well-made.  Shocker, right?

Where its successor uses surreal magic as a basis for fantastical levels, puzzles, and action sequences, A Way Out leans on ideas from crime-thriller cinema.  You and your partner will more-or-less re-enact movie and TV scenes about prison breaks and [life on the lam](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/) - helping them survive a yard beating, distracting guards while they smuggle an escape tool, giving them a boost to the air vent - inbetween trite minigames like "mash X to bench-press weights."

A Way Out's storytelling also feels heavily influenced by (what I assume are) [Josef Fares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Fares)'s favorite films, although that narrative doesn't really warm up until the game is mostly over.  Its first half or so over-emphasizes purely mechanical scenarios for the sake of gimmicky co-opportunities, neglecting plot and character development; It Takes Two's story may have been [far from perfect]($SiteBaseURL$2022/02/20/it-takes-two-people-and-a-generous-number-of-drinks/), but it was certainly *paced* better than this.

(This game also suffers from a bit more not-quite-right English than its follow-up -- totally understandable, for a Swedish developer, but very noticable in settings like "American prison" and "American trailer park.")

And it should be - unfortunately - unsurprising that A Way Out also suffers from occasional-to-frequent confusing button prompts, *missing* button prompts, and frustrating controls.  I don't think that the game ever explicitly tells you that you need to "move" away from cover to detach from it; you've just got to figure that out by accident or luck.

Co-op games *that don't suck* are few and far between, so, I appreciate that A Way Out put in the effort.  But I appreciate even more that Hazelight continued banging this drum with It Takes Two, and I hope they continue refining these ideas with whatever they do next.

**Better than**: <game:Biped>  
**Not as good as**: <game:It Takes Two>  
**It's hard to call out some of the clearest film references without spoiling anything**: but in general, if you've watched a movie about organized crime, you'll probably find this story pretty familiar.
