Lengthy sections of text, random dice-roll checks, having to wait while you walk to an objective, overly-sporadic autosaves; [Disco Elysium](game:Disco Elysium: The Final Cut) checks quite a few of my "no, thanks" boxes.  So it's <i>especially</i> remarkable, thanks to its thoroughly engrossing writing and world-building, that I'm still interested in playing it.  (Even after I <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/rp67l4/talked_to_cuno_throwing_rocks_at_the_body_next">died abruptly from a mean kid damaging my morale</a>.)

Disco Elysium puts its best foot immediately forward, and it's a hell of a foot: your avatar's consciousness is its own character -- multiple characters, in fact.  The call of the void, the thirst for adventure, the pull of chemical addiction, all of these urges are implemented as personalities - voiced by the same actor, with unique inflections - who tell the avatar's story and who you (the player) interact with via dialog choices.

And as you learn more about the game world's mildly-retro dystopian <i>motif</i>, these insane personalities fit snugly into it.  The avatar is a train-wreck of a person, living in a train-wreck of a world.

Throw in the (from what little I've played) heavy emphasis on non-combat challenges, like persuasion or investigation, influenced by a number of point-based mental skills like <a href="https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Rhetoric">Rhetoric</a> and <a href="https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Shivers">Shivers</a> ... yeah.  I want more of this.

I'll just need to remember to dote on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/e4umiz/i_just_died_completely_randomly_to_losing_my_only/">the F5 key</a> from now on.
