Rarely, very rarely, a game will come out and seem like it's "for me." Not just a new [Zelda](tag:The Legend of Zelda) or another [crime sandbox](tag:Grand Theft Auto), I mean: occasionally it feels like a game [has targeted me, personally]($SiteBaseURL$2024/03/10/two-point-oh/). So while I really hadn't intended to splurge on a <platform:Switch 2> so soon, this [collectathon platformer](game:Super Mario Odyssey) sandbox [with destructible terrain](game:Red Faction: Guerrilla) forced my hand.

<game:Donkey Kong Bananza> *absolutely* lives up to the promise implied by a <game:Super Mario Odyssey> follow-up. Like Odyssey, every time Bananza reveals a new "sub-level" - a layer of strata on DK's way to the planet core - the environment is always joyously imaginative, visually delightful, and richly stuffed with details to discover.

Bananza very quickly establishes that its [downward journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_Center_of_the_Earth) is about much, much more than dirt and magma; layers have their own flora and fauna, lakes and waterfalls, even simulated skies and suns. (The beach resort layer is one of my personal favorites.)

*And* like Odyssey, Bananza's continuous surprises and delights include a seemingly endless supply of game mechanics: every sub-level introduces new types of terrain which may be uniquely helpful or hazardous, teaching you new traversal techniques; and new enemy types which move and attack in fresh ways, teaching you new tactics.

The titular "bananza" abilities, where DK hulks-out (using *bananergy*) into a super-buff animal with special powers, are practically underwhelming compared to the crazy variety of game elements happening *around* DK.

And, of course, the collectible bananas and fossils littering the world can be used to unlock skills - and *outfits!* - which addictively feed back into that classic collectathon game loop of exploring, collecting, exploring more, collecting more, exploring...

**Oh yeah, destructible terrain!** Bananza's <tag:Red Faction>-esque twist, despite being one of my favorite features in any game, is easy to forget because it's *so embedded* in Bananza's core gameplay.

Digging tunnels through the map isn't (just) a way of exploiting the terrain's intent, nor is it a shallow excuse to hide collectibles underground; DK's punch-based terraforming is an intrinsic part of environmental puzzle solving, those puzzles continuously evolving as new terrain types *and terrain-combination reactions* come up.

Donkey Kong Bananza is a compelling iteration on the 3D Mario formula, full of creatively awesome levels and mechanics, supporting a wealth of collectible-filled worlds to explore and conquer. *AND THEN* it slips in a ton of grin-inducing references to <tag:Donkey Kong Country> history: familiar background theme music, Cranky's tedious rants, side-scrolling challenge levels...

>!The genuinely shocking reveal of the "real" final boss, and subsequent fake-out ending, and "really finally real" final encounter, had me groaning and smiling the whole time. What an incredible homage to the <platform:SNES> games' own fake-ending bullshit.!<

Aside from occasional camera awkwardness when punching through tunnels - and I mean, that's pretty understandable - it's hard to cite any shortfall or disappointment in DK's deepest, punchiest adventure.

**Better than**: <game:Super Mario Odyssey>  
**Not as good as**: <game:The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom>, I guess?  
**All I want now**: is more content! ... but, no, [not this content](game:Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald Rush).

*Progress: 1000 bananas*
