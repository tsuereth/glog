[Shivering Isles](game:The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles) presents a narratively focused, *madly* energetic alternative to [Oblivion](game:The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered)'s open-world sprawl.

The expansion makes its distinct attitude clear as soon as you enter the Isles, see its bizarre landscapes, and greet its unhinged NPCs. These guys are *nuts*. And the introductory quests you get from those nuts - collecting bones from a garden, stealing a sorceress's tears - set the tone for your upcoming journey through even more weird environments, wild enemies, and wacky quest-givers.

The real star of this show, though, is [Sheogorath](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sheogorath). Once you reach his throne room and start taking his tasks to stop the Greymarch, the mad prince's candidly out-of-his-damn-mind personality becomes the center of the Shivering Isles storyline; his bonkers dialog is the narrative foundation that starts every quest, as well as the payoff for completing them.

Even *despite* Bethesda's continued reliance on [the same voice actor forever](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0426432/), Sheogorath is written and acted incredibly, enchantingly well. (Which is why it's such a shame that the main quest ends >!with his Jyggalag alter-ego reciting a bland parting speech, and Sheogorath leaving forever; farewell, sweet crazy prince!<.)

Not to say that Shivering Isles completely re-thinks Oblivion's approach to world-building: the expansion's world map, though satisfyingly contained, still includes lots of dead area; and there are several bland-and-dreary mushroom caves in place of the main game's bland-and-dreary Oblivion Gates.

But it's nevertheless an exciting counterpoint, an engaging and self-contained story that shows promise for ... well, for [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim) and [its](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard) own [expansions](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dragonborn).

**Better than**: <game:Fallout 4: Far Harbor>  
**Not as good as**: <game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard>, <game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dragonborn>  
**I'm still not sure what I should expect**: from <game:The Elder Scrolls VI>; hopefully more focused stories and more strong personalities, but if not, at least there'll always be plenty of these remasters!
