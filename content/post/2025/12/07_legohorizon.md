I've [previously]($SiteBaseURL$2020/11/27/go-go-power-ninja/) [observed]($SiteBaseURL$2021/03/03/im-going-on-two-thirds-of-an-adventure/) that I tend to like LEGO tie-in games based on my attachment to that "tie-in" -- and <game:Horizon Zero Dawn> is a strong one to tee up. Unfortunately <game:LEGO Horizon Adventures> isn't as tied-into its inspiration as I was hoping.

LEGO games are kid-friendly by necessity, so it's not a surprise that Horizon's T-rated dystopian narrative would need some *reinterpretation*: LEGO Horizon presents a lighthearted, cartoony version of the original world and its events. Ancient technology left behind by "the old ones" is just a passing fascination, or a prop used for visual gags; Helis the mad Carja warlord is obsessed with sun, like, *tanning* in the sun; a holographic Elisabet Sobeck helps Aloy stop ~~HADES~~ *the angry red sphere* while glossing over the whole Faro Plague extinction thing.

I think there was some real potential in this idea, especially with the familiar voices of [Aloy](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3950075) and [Rost](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1072611) and [Varl](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3025293) and [Erend](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394204). (This Ashly Burch performance gives Aloy a little [Tiny Tina](tag:Borderlands) energy, which is delightful.) But in practice, **so much of Horizon is missing** - not just the whole sci-fi backstory, but also Zero Dawn's contemporary stories, like Erend's quest after his sister; Sun-King Avad versus the Shadow Carja; the Banuk tribe altogether; heck, Mother's Heart is the *only* named location here - with so many omissions, LEGO Horizon's world ends up feeling almost unrelated to its inspiration.

Considering Horizon Zero Dawn and [Forbidden West](game:Horizon Forbidden West) had great big open worlds to explore, full of memorable places and people and moments; and considering *some* previous LEGO games (like [LEGO LotR](game:LEGO The Lord of the Rings (Android, iOS, Mac, PC, PS3, Wii, X360))'s Middle-earth, <game:LEGO Marvel Super Heroes>'s Manhattan, and <game:LEGO City Undercover>'s ... LEGO City) have also pulled off open-world exploration; it's a real shame that LEGO Horizon lacks any of that scope. Even this game's campaign levels are just pseudo-random arrangements of generic level "pieces" -- small sections of forest or mountain or jungle or desert, with loading-screen transitions inbetween each section. Sections which feel increasingly repetitive if you bother revisiting them in the post-game.

Which I did! Because I'm a sucker for this formula, for the popcorn-like collectibles to unlock, even though these too are a disappointment compared to past LEGO games. (LEGO Horizon has a ton of *costumes* and other decorative unlockables, but only four playable characters. <game:LEGO Marvel Super Heroes> had an unlockable Stan Lee!)

LEGO Horizon Adventures *isn't a bad game,* it's a perfectly playable iteration of the tried-and-true LEGO game formula established by <tag:Traveller's Tales>. But a lack of meaningful connection to Horizon, and an underwhelming amount of content, make it one of that formula's weaker entries.

**Better than**: ... <game:Hob> ?  
**Not as good as**: <game:LEGO City Undercover>, <game:LEGO Marvel's Avengers>, <game:The LEGO Movie Videogame>  
**Weirdly, though**: LEGO Horizon *was not* developed by Traveller's Tales, instead being co-developed by [Guerrilla](tag:Guerrilla Games) and partner <tag:Studio Gobo>. Kinda odd that they mimicked the button-mashy parts of TT's games, without the open-world or huge-character-library parts.
