I first booted up <game:Deep Rock Galactic> way back in May of 2020, for some COVID-lockdown virtual socialization.  It didn't stick with me then; I was confused by the different mission structures, and the progression mechanics felt grindy.  I moved on.

Years later, my <game:Palworld> and <game:Ara: History Untold> virtual crew was looking for something new, and ... well, *now* I'm hooked.

It was DRG's colorful and collectible-filled seasonal events, [Yuletide](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/538840670729666756) and [Lunar Festival](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/539970369596948596) and [Anniversary](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/538847007103517263) and [Great Egg Hunt](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/505073809906204709), that actually piqued my interest; I loved that every few weeks we were greeted by new Space Rig decorations, and there were new holiday-themed twists in our missions.  (I've been missing those events, I hope there's a summer one coming up.)

And it takes more than a little practice to "get it" -- to understand how each dwarf's mobility tools really work, and how to efficiently tackle each type of objective, and which weapon upgrades are worthwhile.

And *then* it takes *more* work to unlock the mechanics that make Deep Rock worth coming back to week after week, month after month: [promoting](https://deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Promotion) your dwarves and collecting [overclocks](https://deeprockgalactic.wiki.gg/wiki/Weapon_Overclocks) that can power up your weapons even further.

Is it a grind?  Yeah, it sure is.

But once it *clicks*, once the mechanics finally make sense, the exploring-and-mining gameplay - with friends, with drinks, with the dwarves' lighthearted banter - and the unpredictable emergent moments of randomly-assembled missions, like when your Dreadnought boss fight is interrupted by a swarm of exploding bugs ... it feels *worth* some grinding.
