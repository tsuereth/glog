... what was I doing here again? ... was it building a dark matter factory?  No! that's right, I was blogging about video games.

<game:Satisfactory> has *consumed* me over the past couple months, late into the night connecting assembly lines, and early the next morning calculating production requirements for a milestone part.  It's got that same ["just one more step" addictiveness]($SiteBaseURL$2020/08/22/burning-the-midnight-oil/) that <game:Factorio> hooked me on -- and while it's easy to summarize Satisfactory as first-person Factorio, there are some differences which help sustain that addiction *even longer*.

One is its world map, meaning, it *has* a world map: a deterministic and (at least partially) hand-crafted arrangement of diverse geographic features and landmarks.  It's no [Hyrule](tag:The Legend of Zelda) or [Toussaint](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine), there's not much "story" to weave into it, but Satisfactory's map is varied and intriguing enough that - while you're searching for more resources or tracking rare collectibles - there's a sense of "new," of freshness that comes from exploring (then exploiting) its nooks and crannies.

The terrain makes great use of verticality, not just for visually-awesome cliffside beaches and towering rock pillars, but as a basis for construction gameplay.  Like Factorio, Satisfactory makes you rely heavily on conveyor belts to move materials around; but being able to build them in 3D space, and thread conveyors around hills and through valleys and even caves! adds another fun, well, *dimension* to the construction game.

(Although I do wish Satisfactory would make it easier to build ultra-long conveyor lines, 'cause having to draw out one segment under the length limit, then another, then another... can be a bit tedious.)

Satisfactory also includes some non-conveyor-belt logistical solutions, but - with the exception of a train line that supplied distant resources to my "main" factory complex - I wasn't very compelled to use them.  (I had a cargo truck following a programmed path, for a bit, but that was more trouble than it was worth; and I never even bothered trying the late-game delivery drones.)

One more non-obvious difference between Satisfactory and Factorio is combat: there *are* hostile alien creeps in this game, including some absolutely hateful and GIANT jumping spiders, but **they naturally avoid your buildings**.  You need weapons to defend yourself while exploring, but your factories don't require any defensive fortification, and you're always safe while hanging out around machinery.

That enables some *coziness* while you're building out factories and manually assembling parts, which is ... pretty great!  It may seem strange that "idling" is a positive feature of the game, since it can detract from "automating" and "optimizing" objectives -- but being able to chill and take it slow is actually kinda nice.

Like I said, first-person Factorio is a straightforward - if reductive - way to sum up Satisfactory; it scratches the same itch, but has more staying power thanks to a well-crafted world and flexible mechanical design.  Almost 200 hours later, I sure am satisfied.

**Better than**: <game:Factorio>  
**Not as good as**: I dunno, like, <game:The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom>?  
**Now that I've got my factory-building fix**: guess it's back to real-life automation work. *sigh*

*Progress: completed Phase 5, and all production milestones and research trees in version 1.0*
