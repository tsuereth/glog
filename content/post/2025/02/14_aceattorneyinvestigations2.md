Since it languished without an official English translation for *almost 14 years*, I was immensely surprised that <game:Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit> tells **an incredibly good story** -- not only an improvement over Edgeworth's [earlier, chronologically-chaotic investigation](game:Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth), but one of the best in <tag:Ace Attorney>'s long history.

I was less-pleasantly surprised by just **how shitty its (il)logical puzzles** are.  I've lamented this before - *"sometimes-confounding evidence solutions"* ([Trials and Tribulations]($SiteBaseURL$2019/06/09/closed-pending-new-evidence/)), *"leap-of-logic evidence puzzles"* ([Apollo Justice]($SiteBaseURL$2024/03/02/cold-cases/)), *"expected connections are a leap too far"* ([Edgeworth's last game]($SiteBaseURL$2025/02/01/detective-prosecutor-inspector-edgeworth-esquire/)) - but I don't think any Ace Attorney game's been quite this bad.  *Maybe* <game:Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney> was worse; it's hard to remember.

It's worth spoiling one of the first chapter's deduction puzzles to prove my point.  While investigating an attempted assassination:

* One clue is a photograph of the target, flanked by bodyguards, with a bright red dot on his forehead.

* Another clue is a red laser pointer found at the scene.

Can Edgeworth deduce that the red dot was painted by the laser pointer?  **No**; he must first connect that photo to another image, from a newspaper article about the target, to deduce that *the red dot is not a birthmark*.

Investigations 2 is littered with counter-intuitive puzzles like this, deductions that seem unnecessarily obvious or evidence connections that aren't foreshadowed or hinted at all.  And then there's Mind Chess, which despite being a thematically-awesome idea...

![]($SiteBaseURL$ace-attorney-investigations-2-prosecutors-gambit_mind-chess.jpg){width=960 height=540}

... uses mechanical rules that are never explained very well (I don't feel like I really "got" it until the game's 4th chapter), and punishes wrong guesses by rewinding - forcing you to re-attempt - *multiple* dialog-tree choices.

[Bring a guide](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney_Investigations_2:_Prosecutor%27s_Gambit/Walkthrough).  You'll need some outside help to resolve these investigations.

*And they're worth resolving!*  That's the thing: in spite of its mechanical frustrations, this "Prosecutor's Gambit" absolutely pays off.

In my last post, I called out the previous game's *"sincerely confusing"* chronology; Investigations 2 tells its story in-order, *and also* uses flashback scenes in sensible, clever ways -- fleshing out a years-old case with Edgeworth's dad, as it relates to a present-day investigation of similar scenes and characters.

I also griped that protagonist Miles Edgeworth saw *"very little character growth"* in his first game; Investigations 2 challenges Miles to learn from [his reunion with Phoenix](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (NDS)), to do more than simply move past his [old "perfect prosecutor" ways](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Manfred_von_Karma) and really question how he can serve the goal of *justice*.

(His character development here adds an exciting, satisfying dimension to the more-experienced Edgeworth we see in [Dual Destinies](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies) and [Spirit of Justice](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice).)

I *also* complained that in the first Investigations, without a regular courtroom or witness stand, supporting characters tended to *"feel picked-up and then thrown-away"*; Investigations 2 more deliberately and more frequently replicates an Ace Attorney "courtroom feel" when interrogating subjects in the field, developing their stories and stressing-out their personalities over multiple rounds of dialog combat.  It even has a **traveling judge**!

Investigations 2 totally paves over its predecessors' narrative gaps, on top of maintaining this franchise's flair for delightfully absurd characters...

... and for, I can't say this enough, **expert localization** that positively oozes personality and charm.

This may be my favorite Ace Attorney **soundtrack**, to boot.  Especially when Edgeworth is pushing his cross-examination (and Mind Chess) opponents hardest, this music is some of the pulse-pounding-est that Capcom's ever produced, more thrilling than [Apollo Justice](game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney) or even <game:Mega Man ZX>.  I've never been so *pumped* to click dialog choices and watch text appear in a box.

I'm so glad to have finally played Edgeworth's story -- and that's really what Investigations 2 feels like, regardless of recurring guests like Gumshoe and Larry, regardless of references to other games' cases.  **This is a story about Miles Edgeworth**, standing proud and strong on his own.

**Better than**: <game:Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth>, <game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney>, <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice> (... though it'd be close, if this game's logic puzzles weren't so stupid)  
**So that's the whole series remastered, then**: wonder if we'll [survive long enough](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/thanks-to-nasa-you-probably-wont-have-to-worry-about-this-asteroid-killing-you/) to see a *new* <tag:Ace Attorney> game.
