Fifteen years on, <game:Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth> might still be my least-favorite <tag:Ace Attorney> game.  But! the [Collection](game:Ace Attorney Investigations Collection)'s high-def remake *improves* the game, enough that it's satisfying to play through despite some deep flaws.

Edgeworth's side-view investigation scenes **work better on a big screen**: where hunting for clues on an <platform:NDS> touchscreen was a fiddly squint-and-poke exercise, now there's plenty of room to walk around and much more detailed art to grab your eye.

Likewise, high-resolution character portraits and backgrounds let this game lean farther than it once did into the Ace Attorney franchise's *flair for drama*.

As always, Ace Attorney shines when its absurd characters are front and center -- but Edgeworth's cases just don't exploit that as much as Phoenix's and Apollo's.  Although investigation scenes do include Cross Examination-like dialog combat, and Edgeworth's opponents react bombastically when their contradictions are pointed out, the game *almost never* uses these in sequence to continue building tension.  Instead, most witnesses or suspects tend to feel picked-up and then thrown-away before their character has had a chance to develop.

Edgeworth himself experiences very little character growth, only showing slight development in the final chapter by begrudgingly acknowledging the "turnabout" logic championed by his blue-suited friend.  *(Who goes [weirdly unnamed]($SiteBaseURL$2010/02/28/ace-attorney-investigations-miles-edgeworth-4/), despite other cameo guest appearances.)*

Not that a deep-dive into Edgeworth's story would be easy to follow, anyway, as this game's chronology is sincerely confusing: its 2nd and 3rd chapters take place before the 1st, then after a 4th-chapter flashback to *years* earlier, chapter 5 picks back up where chapter 1 left off.  I don't think the order of narrative events needed to be this disjointed; I think the game was just poorly paced.

And so long as I'm being negative, same as [I lamented in 2010]($SiteBaseURL$2010/02/28/ace-attorney-investigations-miles-edgeworth-4/), the "Logic" mechanic of connecting clues to reach a conclusion is *neat when it works* but often feels like bullshit.  Many of the game's expected connections are a leap too far, or alternatively so obvious that I couldn't believe Edgeworth needed help to reach the conclusion.

So yeah, this is definitely a weaker Ace Attorney game, between mechanical awkwardness and rough story pacing and lack of memorable characterization.  But like I said at the top, remaking its character art and its investigation scenes in high definition *succeeds* in elevating Ace Attorney Investigations to feel more at-home among its courtroom peers.
