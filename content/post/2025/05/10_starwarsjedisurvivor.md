> But a [[Fallen Order](game:Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order)] sequel could *inject* some personality into [its characters], and if it focuses up on polishing a smaller feature-set - instead of doing a mediocre job of imitating four different genres - I could absolutely see [Respawn](https://www.respawn.com/) delivering a Jedi iteration that's truly exciting from start to finish.

That was my wishful, optimistic hypothesis [three years ago]($SiteBaseURL$2022/05/28/is-this-where-the-fun-begins/).  But I guess the simpler and more-likely outcome for <game:Star Wars Jedi: Survivor> was always going to be "more of the same" and, yeah, that's what it is.

Just like its predecessor, Survivor *crams* together <tag:Dark Souls> map mechanics and stamina-based combat, poorly-interconnected worlds that "can" be revisited but aren't worth the effort, clunkily-controlled <tag:Uncharted> action sequences, and a story with some well-acted scenes but which lacks an overall compelling (or coherent) plot.

The resulting mess is, well, it's kinda like when a game looks beautiful in a screenshot -- but real-time motion suffers from awful framerates or glitchy visual effects.  What I mean is, there are *sweet moments* in Survivor - wall-running through a canyon, force-pulling a structure down to crush stormtroopers - and when you see intriguing landmarks on the horizon, hear an NPC talk about some side-story, or survey points of interest on the map, it feels like the game is *promising* a whole lot more exciting content.

But those promises are consistently let down by repetitive and punishing fights; by unclear and inconsistent platforming behavior; by underwhelming puzzle and exploration rewards (yeah, more lightsaber cosmetics!); and by a *weirdly-paced* story which is only really memorable for how *absurd* its third-act twist is.

... and by some truly incredible [technical issues](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/star-wars-jedi-survivor-known-issues-list-of-bugs-glitches-and-fixes), even though post-release patches have made some progress, there are still *glaring* problems.  My living room setup's GPU (AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT w/ 8GB VRAM), for example, just *wouldn't load most textures* (like other reports around the interweb: [1](https://forums.ea.com/discussions/star-wars-jedi-survivor-en/textures-not-loading-jedi-survivor/10698695), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/133vizj/jedi_survivor_textures_not_loading_properly_or/), [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarWarsJediSurvivor/comments/15b8ip0/jedi_survivor_texture_not_loading/)), making many sections of the game literally **unplayable due to visual unclarity**; I had to stream it from a different PC instead.

*(no, this isn't what it's supposed to look like.)*

As before, maybe a Souls superfan will get something out of this - particularly the unforgiving combat, which can be downright *relentless* as the game proceeds, like the >!Jedha Archive Darth Vader!< encounter was too tough for me even on "Padawan" difficulty - but otherwise, there's not much here to praise.  I'm already struggling to remember those set-piece "sweet moments," days later.

If somehow, [despite crippling layoffs](https://www.reuters.com/technology/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game-bloomberg-news-reports-2025-04-29/), there does end up being a third Cal Kestis game: I don't expect it to be any different.

*Progress: finished on Story difficulty.*
