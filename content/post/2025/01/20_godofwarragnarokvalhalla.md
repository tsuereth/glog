The rogue-like genre, or more abstractly *resetting progress as a game mechanic*, isn't generally my thing.  But sometimes a die-and-retry game does something cool enough to suck me in, like <game:Middle-earth: Shadow of War - Desolation of Mordor>'s Batman-like gadgets.  In <game:God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla>'s case, it was **story**.

It seems light at first: Valhalla's premise, set after the events of <game:God of War Ragnarök>, is a thin mystery (who invited Kratos to Valhalla?) and a gradually-revealed post-ending beat (Freya setting Kratos up as the new, uh, God of War).

But as you push farther into Valhalla's labyrinth, a more meaningful narrative's dots start to connect -- referencing Kratos's previous exploits in Greece, his regret and guilt, and his desire to "be better."

It does struggle a bit with, well, the passage of time; I can barely remember what Kratos did 15-20 years ago on <platform:PS2>.  But Valhalla uses its Kratos-and-Mimir banter and some animated flashback scenes to recap the relevant points.

(Valhalla also re-introduces the [Blade of Olympus](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Blade_of_Olympus) weapon as a Rage ability, which is *fucking rad*.)

I'm still not a huge fan of re-playing combat gauntlets with randomized upgrades - which is why I only bothered with Valhalla's easiest "Show Me Will" difficulty - but this DLC mode gave me the narrative content I wanted without wearing out its welcome.

**Better than**: <game:Middle-earth: Shadow of War - Desolation of Mordor>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores>  
**Though...**: I *do not* have the patience to re-run Valhalla enough times to see [Sigrun's full story](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Sigr%C3%BAn#God_of_War_Ragnar%C3%B6k:_Valhalla).
