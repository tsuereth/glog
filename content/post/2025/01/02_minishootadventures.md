<game:Minishoot' Adventures> is *kinda* like a top-down alternative to <game:Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet>.  (From what I can remember of 2011, anyway.)

That is, it's a [metroidvania](https://store.steampowered.com/category/metroidvania) schmup: you're a little spaceship cruising through an interconnected map with progressively-unblocked obstacles.  And it has RPG elements!  Shoot enemies and environment elements (like bushes and ... clay pots?) to earn experience, level-up to upgrade shot damage and range and movement speed, delve into dungeons and defeat bosses to unlock new abilities, use those abilities to open new areas and do it all over again.

Its soothing color palette and cozy-feeling starting area belie how **bullet-hell-ey** some encounters can get, and they're a little *more hell* than I'd like, even on the easy "Explorer" mode.  Especially in the early game, when you're low on max health and ability upgrades, fights with screen-filling bullets can feel unfair.  But those frustrations do fade as the game goes on, and you become better able to handle (or avoid) getting hit.

And the [open-ish world](game:Open World Game: The Open World Game) is a lot of fun to fly around in, full of slightly-hidden secrets to find and power-ups to accumulate.  It's a great fix for a map-exploration addict like myself.

**Better than**: <game:Forma.8>, <game:Hob>  
**Not as good as**: <game:Iconoclasts>  
**Unfair comparison, but also not as good as**: character-action 'vanias like <game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night> and <game:Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow>

*Progress: 100% map completion, beat "the final boss" and also "the true last boss" in Explorer mode.*
