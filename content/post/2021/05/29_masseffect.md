Even in its time, the first {{% game "Mass Effect" %}}Mass Effect{{% /game %}} was a mixed bag.  The {{% game "Mass Effect Legendary Edition" %}}Legendary Edition{{% /game %}} remaster shows that its good qualities still hold up; despite its bad qualities, which the remaster has ... also preserved.

Maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that the Legendary Edition still has lackluster side-missions, an empty-feeling galaxy, narrow characterization choices, and confounding inventory management.  (The item limit is higher, now, but cleaning items out remains a chore.)

It <i>is</i> a little surprising that auto-saves are still infrequent, menu navigation still doesn't work quite right with a mouse, and <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Mass-Effect-1/Mass-Effect-final-battle-and-corresponding-cutscenes-freeze-PS3/td-p/327526">decade-old stability bugs</a> are still <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Mass-Effect-Legendary-Edition/ME1-LE-crash-during-saren-citadel-fight/td-p/10360317">around today</a>.

And while I can appreciate that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/you-can-disable-mass-effect-legendary-editions-improved-mako-handling-if-you-like-pain/"><i>controlling</i> the Mako is less painful</a>, the barren landscapes you drive through are still painfully un-fun.

But the sometimes-tedious gunplay, the often-awkward dialog, and the usually-dull exploration are still worth tolerating for the sake of Mass Effect's intricate and enchanting universe.  Just like my first time through, I was happy to spend <i>hours upon hours</i> digesting the game's lore through conversations and the in-game codex.

The "world" is the real star of this show, and the Legendary Edition's updated graphics show it off splendidly.

... I mean, given how much-improved I remember {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}the next game{{% /game %}} being, I might still consider this entry little more than a prologue.  But it's a fine prologue, just like it was before.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "3030 Deathwar Redux" %}}3030 Deathwar Redux{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" %}}Uncharted: Drake's Fortune{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Horizon Zero Dawn" %}}Horizon Zero Dawn{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves" %}}Uncharted 2: Among Thieves{{% /game %}}  
<b>As for the DLC</b>: well... {{% game "Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky" %}}I'll be brief{{% /game %}}.

<i>Progress: Finished on Normal.</i>
