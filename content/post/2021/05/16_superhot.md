<game:SuperHot> certainly doesn't wear out its welcome.

At about 90 minutes of linear content, the game is more than just a well-polished tech demo, but there's still not much meat on its bones.  The story is a fun-enough throwaway, with an "illusion of choice" motif that evokes (but doesn't measure up to) <game:Spec Ops: The Line> or [BioShock](game:BioShock Remastered); and the extra collectibles and other post-game features don't really seem worth exploring.

SuperHot's core gameplay, a balance between first-person shooting and puzzle-like movement tactics, is ... pretty fun!  And with complementary mechanics like throwing objects, disarming enemies, and turning a dude's gun right back onto him, that tactical-shooting action remains engaging throughout the story's 20-30 short levels.

I don't know if I'd say that it left me wanting more, though; I feel pretty satisfied with what I got.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mr. Shifty>, <game:Rogue Warrior>, <game:Wanted: Weapons of Fate>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Portal>  
<b>Now, if there was a [rewind feature](game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time), encouraging longer and more-intricate levels</b>: <i>then</i> I'd be up for more.

<i>Progress: Finished the story levels.</i>
