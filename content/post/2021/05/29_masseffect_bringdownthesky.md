Like I said, <game:Mass Effect>'s side missions are lackluster and dull.  The [Bring Down the Sky](game:Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky) DLC, included in the [Legendary Edition](game:Mass Effect Legendary Edition) package, is <i>better</i>... but not by much.

There is at least a little gameplay variety (avoiding proximity mines!), and a short storyline to follow, in this DLC's single narrative mission.

And then it's over.  Seriously, this is one mission's worth of content.  And an optional additional objective.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary>  
<b>Did anyone seriously pay</b>: $5 back in 2008 for this one-hour side-mission?  I hope not.

<i>Progress: Finished the main mission, but the scientists are still missing.</i>
