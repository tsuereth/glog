{{% game "Anodyne" %}}Anodyne{{% /game %}} is <i>creepy</i>.  {{% game "Magrunner: Dark Pulse" %}}Magrunner: Dark Pulse{{% /game %}} is <i>horrific</i>.  {{% game "Oxenfree" %}}Oxenfree{{% /game %}} is <i>surreal</i>.  {{% game "Jazzpunk" %}}Jazzpunk{{% /game %}} is <i>absurd</i>.  {{% game "Killer Is Dead" %}}Killer Is Dead{{% /game %}} is <i>eccentric</i>.  {{% game "Wuppo: Definitive Edition" %}}Wuppo{{% /game %}} is <i>inscrutable</i>.

All of these words are synonyms for "weird."  And {{% game "Kentucky Route Zero" %}}Kentucky Route Zero{{% /game %}} is all of those.  It's <i>weird</i>.

"Weird" isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact I would more often call it a good thing -- it can be the difference between a rote reiteration and a memorable innovator.  But in the case of Kentucky Route Zero, a "weird" mysterious plot is tempered by "weird" hard-to-follow story structure; and seriously impeded by "weird" UI, with visually-ambiguous navigation and cumbersome point-and-click prompts.

I'm not sure if I'd call Kentucky Route Zero <i>too weird</i>, but I would at least call it <i>weird in a bad way</i>.  Tantalizing curiosity I can sign up for; disorienting smash cuts and off-puttingly clunky controls, not so much.
