I never outright <i>said</i> that <game:Trine 2> demonstrated an ignorance of [the original game](game:Trine)'s design shortcomings, and an inordinate focus on shiny graphical effects; I just <i>thought</i> it, very loudly.  Catching up to [Trine 3](game:Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power), though, I don't think it even needs to be said -- the game gives itself away.

The sky is shiny, the water is shiny, the foliage is shiny, ... everything is shiny.  But in moving from 2D side-scrolling levels to a fixed-camera 3D format, with depth, one wonders if Frozenbyte learned anything from 1990s beat-em-ups: when the camera is fixed to the side, z-axis movement doesn't make the game more interesting; just more difficult to understand.

User reviews further indicate that this iteration of Trine loses character progression, i.e. developing advanced skills in later levels, <i>and</i> that the level count overall is shockingly low.

The promise of a new <tag:The Lost Vikings> I saw in the first Trine feels like a mirage, now.  Even the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/319910/discussions/0/528398719797223737/">developers' self-reflection</a> and the [now-released sequel](game:Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince) don't dissuade me from the conviction that these guys, great as they may be at making a super-shiny physics-based engine, aren't really interested in making a puzzle-platform game.

<i>Progress: Finished the first level.</i>
