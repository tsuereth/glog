Narratively speaking, [Shadowrun: Hong Kong](game:Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition) is a direct attack on my grievances toward [Dragonfall](game:Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut), and it's a <i>critical hit</i>.

The main story is more personal and grounded, even when it's revealing grand fantastical portents; story events are impactful because they're related by, and reflected in, believable NPC dialog.  Compared to the Kreuzbasar's ambient but mostly-inconsequential conversations -- the "flavor" text in Heoi is much more filling.

Party-member backstories, too, feel more significant and fascinating than those in the last campaign.  Everyone has tons of dialog to read, and everyone's got at least one mission with fairly-personal stakes.  Not all the character arcs are great: Duncan doesn't develop much, and Is0bel's story leaves some loose ends.  But Racter... man, that guy is <b>memorable</b>.

The scripted events of each mission are as engaging as ever, and alternate route options (especially using Charisma instead of a gun) have continued to improve.  I will however confess that I often played with a guide next to me, to make sure I chose the "right" option for interesting gameplay results; unfortunately, Shadowrun has a long way to go before its "bad" choices feel as satisfying as [Geralt](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)'s.

There is also a somewhat dramatic balance issue in Hong Kong's open-ended missions: while the difficulty of a mission scales with your progress, the <i>rewards don't</i>, and it's definitely not obvious when a mission might give you <i>no money</i>.  I had to retry a lot of difficult fights (even on Easy mode!) early in Act 2 because I hadn't earned enough money to upgrade my main character's equipment.

That aside, Hong Kong's combat gameplay is still good <i>enough</i> to be generally satisfying.  Despite that scaling hurdle, and despite the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">inconceivable</a> number of times I missed an 80%-to-hit shot, combat is just as fun (or at least tolerable) as before.

That being said -- while Hong Kong's real-world combat is familiar, its virtual-world Decking has been significantly remodeled.  And much as I admire that The Matrix is now more lively, and includes some brand-new puzzle mechanics... in practice, the overabundance of "Watcher" enemies turns virtual-world traversal into an annoying stealth game, and the hacking minigame becomes repetitive almost immediately.  Bit of a swing and a miss.

But even though I occasionally lamented having to access The Matrix - just as I occasionally lamented having to fight an obnoxious number of bad dudes - I did it, eagerly, to uncover more of Hong Kong's and my party's fascinating lore.

I do still miss the tightly-paced drama (and, honestly, the impossible-to-screw-up combat) of [Dead Man's Switch](game:Shadowrun Returns); even so, I'd count Hong Kong's blend of narrative focus and non-linear progression as Shadowrun's strongest campaign yet.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut>, <game:Shadowrun Returns> (for the most part)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided>  
<b>Where's my next sci-fi fantasy fix?</b>: hmm... how're those <game:Cyberpunk 2077> patches coming?

<i>Progress: Finished the campaign on Easy, including the Shadows of Hong Kong epilogue.</i>
