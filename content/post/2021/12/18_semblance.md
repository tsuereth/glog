<game:Semblance> does an impressive job of explaining its mechanics <i>without</i> explaining them -- like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_1-1#Design_philosophy">infamous opening</a> of <game:Super Mario Bros.>, it places elements in such a way that you'll learn how the game works practically by accident.

And, those mechanics are both pleasantly simple and refreshingly inventive; it put a smile on my face when I realized that environment deformation could be used to "climb" sheer walls, by denting platforms into the side.

Unfortunately...

Actually <i>solving</i> Semblance's puzzles is less gratifying, because of the tweaky, fiddly imprecision of that deformable environment.  Like <game:World of Goo>, or so many other physics-simulation platformers, it's way too easy to "almost" solve a puzzle -- but the ground is a few pixels too high, or the laser angle is a few degrees off, so you need to reset and try it again.

There also isn't any external motivation, no promise of narrative payoff for pushing forward.  As far as I can tell, the story is "purple stuff got infected by green stuff."  If my only reward for fidgeting together a puzzle solution is more puzzles, well, no thanks.

I really, really like Semblance's mechanical premise.  It just needed to do <i>more</i> to keep me interested.
