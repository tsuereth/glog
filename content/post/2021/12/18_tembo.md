{{% game "Tembo the Badass Elephant" %}}Tembo{{% /game %}} is a better {{% tag "Sonic the Hedgehog" %}}Sonic{{% /tag %}}, but not by enough.

See, unlike {{% game "Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit" %}}Hell Yeah!{{% /game %}}, which landed somewhere between "reference" and "parody" -- Tembo actually channels the <i>spirit</i> of a Sonic game, in that it allows you to turn into a destructive ball and charge through obstacles at high speed.  And it doesn't <i>destroy</i> you when you take damage, instead stealing just a <i>portion</i> of your health meter.  And there are checkpoints!

Tembo makes meaningful strides toward letting you go fast, without <i>punishing</i> you for going "too" fast.  But... it doesn't go far enough.

It's not so much the short walls, requiring a jump; or the resilient barriers, requiring multiple hits; but the <i>surprise hazards</i>, enemies with machetes or flame cannons or ... flame tanks?  Even when Tembo forgives you for a momentum-defeating mistake, it still doesn't feel <i>fair</i>, because it's not <i>your</i> fault that the game suddenly decided that you need to stop and reverse direction.

It's also an unfortunate example of user-unfriendly PC porting, between the obviously unhelpful tutorial prompts for my Xbox gamepad:

... and some surprising crash diagnostics when I alt-tabbed away:

It's not like Tembo is bad - I mean, the PC port ain't great - it's just, well, it recognizes that "fast sidescrolling" can be improved upon but doesn't execute on many of those improvements.
