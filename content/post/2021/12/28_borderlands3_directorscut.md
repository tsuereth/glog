Let's get an important warning out of the way, first: <b>don't buy</b> the <game:Borderlands 3> Season Pass 2.  It is <b>an absolute rip-off</b>.

If you bother <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/seasonpass2/">reading into it</a> before purchasing - which I, admittedly, didn't - it should be obvious why: this <i>isn't</i> a collection of extended story chapters, like the <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/borderlands-3-season-pass/">first season pass</a> was (and like <game:Borderlands 2>'s season pass was!).  The majority of Season Pass 2's content is new skills, new cosmetics, new arena challenges, and new raid bosses; <i>superfan</i> stuff, which a superfan would already have via an Ultimate Edition or some similar bullshit.

The only new narrative content is a <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Director\%27s_Cut#Missions">quartet of missions</a> in the [Director's Cut](game:Borderlands 3: Director's Cut) add-on, which sure doesn't seem like a "season" worth of content to me.

Alright, so, here's the good news: those Director's Cut missions are actually pretty fun!  Moreso than the morose and melodramatic [Bounty of Blood](game:Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood - A Fistful of Redemption) and [Fantastic Fustercluck](game:Borderlands 3: Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck), these investigations on behalf of Ava's "Mysteriouslier" podcast demonstrate the kinds of irreverent humor and thrilling pacing that are <i>peak</i> Borderlands.

There's even a solid <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir">film noir</a></i> aesthetic in its intro mission, which, well, is an instant "win" for me.

It's over relatively quickly, at about 2 to 2.5 hours, but "Mysteriouslier" manages to pack some pretty respectable quality into those hours.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 3: Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax>  
<b>But, and I can't stress this enough</b>: this content is <i>not</i> worth <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1396474/Borderlands_3_Season_Pass_2/">Season Pass 2</a>'s $20-30 price tag, or even the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361831/Borderlands_3_Directors_Cut/">Director's Cut</a> itself at $15.  Just consider it a nice bonus if you've already bought "everything" for <game:Borderlands 3>.
