I mean, yeah, {{% game "Splasher" %}}Splasher{{% /game %}}'s paint-twisted platforming feels pretty fresh: bouncing between walls and running along ceilings to get through dangerous, sawblade-filled laboratories is exciting!  Fun, even!  And at least at first, <i>doesn't</i> feel punishing.

But it's got the narrative hooks of a {{% game "Splosion Man" %}}Splosion Man{{% /game %}} - that is, <i>none</i> - which made me suspect that its "appeal" would turn out to be raw, brutal challenge.  And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxE-uIX9q8M">looking ahead a bit</a>, I can see ... yeah.  I don't have the patience for that many lasers.

Glad that I tried more of it, but I'm convinced enough that the rest of the game would be "not for me."

<i>Progress: Finished level 4.</i>
