Replaying <game:Horizon Zero Dawn> does suffer a bit from, for lack of a better term, the [BioShock](game:BioShock Remastered) effect: its story is so memorable that you just can't be shocked and amazed by it a second time.

It's still a great story, though.  And moreso than BioShock - certainly <i>much</i> moreso than <game:BioShock Infinite> - Horizon's gameplay is engaging enough to keep things interesting even inbetween story beats.

I do still have some qualms about how suddenly an enemy can evade your aim, and about how frequently their attacks can interrupt you; kinda hope that [Aloy's next adventure](game:Horizon Forbidden West) gets clearer lock-on/seeking and maybe a "kung fu movie" combat system (enemies waiting their turn to attack).

But knowing what to expect, this time around, helped me focus on what the game does well: building an awe-inspiring world, digging into deeply-intriguing backstory, and keeping tension high with dangerous robots.

Ironically, going into Horizon's sidequests with <i>lowered</i> expectations helped me get more out of them -- not as interesting character moments, but as checkboxes on my completion chart, and excuses to explore more of the richly-detailed world.

It was also helpful to know I should invest in inventory upgrades as soon as possible, to mitigate Horizon's laborious mess of crafting-material management.

But I digress.  Horizon Zero Dawn is still a triumph of game-making, and, not like I needed an excuse to re-play it, but this PC re-release is <i>gorgeous</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Ghost of Tsushima>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt> (agh, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-witcher-3s-free-next-gen-upgrade-has-been-delayed-until-2022/">still waiting</a> for that new-gen update)  
<b>The PC version</b>: has, unfortunately, set my visual and performance expectations for [Forbidden West](game:Horizon Forbidden West) <i>pretty</i> high.

<i>Progress: 100% completion</i>
