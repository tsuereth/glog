I liked {{% game "Massive Chalice" %}}Massive Chalice{{% /game %}} a lot more than I expected to.

Its broad, "Grand Strategy" scope; its deep, statistics-drenched, {{% game "Age of Wonders III" %}}micro-management combat{{% /game %}}; and its randomly-generated characters and events; these are all significant turn-offs for me.  But!

I was pleasantly surprised to find each of those concerns tempered by a light, fun attitude.  Its <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4919320/fullcredits">bickering voice cast</a> brings an entertaining personality to the otherwise-sterile empire-building premise, and holds your hand through tutorializing combat and asset management.  Even the randomly-generated content is pleasantly silly, assuming you choose the "Humorous" content option (instead of "Thematic"); then you, too, can recruit brave warriors like Catkicker Cooke-Gallagher.

And, at least in my initial campaign, I <i>rarely</i> had to sweat the intricate details of dynasty optimization or character loadouts.  When a regent died, the game suggested replacement candidates to me; when I researched new equipment, my vanguard equipped it automatically.  By my campaign's end, selecting the best new hero or the best new researcher or <i>et al</i> was a triviality, every time.

This isn't a genre I ordinarily get into, but for exceptionally well-polished entries like {{% tag "Civilization" %}}Civilization{{% /tag %}} and its "just one more turn" addiction loop.  So I was surprised to find that Massive Chalice tapped into that same addiction; every time I finished a battle, or placed a new regent, I was eager for the next <i>thing</i>, the next event ... whatever that might happen to be.

I won't be starting a new campaign anytime soon, and I'll never forget how repetitive Massive Chalice's combat encounters <i>and</i> empire planning got by the end.  But I had an unexpectedly <i>fun</i> time learning those limits, and I won't forget that fun, either.

<i>Progress: finished a Normal campaign.</i>
