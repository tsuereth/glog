Yeah -- it was [Claptastic Voyage](game:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Claptastic Voyage), when Borderlands last took us inside a party member's "mindscape."  Surprisingly, [Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck](game:Borderlands 3: Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck) makes several of the same mistakes.

Its aesthetically-imaginative level designs <i>look</i> neat, but enemy behaviors and arena layouts are no different from what we've seen before.  (I could only think of one truly-new enemy, the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidingTheBomb">rocket-riding psycho</a>, which is <i>a fun idea</i> but not interesting to fight.)

By focusing the story on one character, and not a very compelling one at that, it neglects two of the franchise's typical narrative strengths: wacky tertiary characters and comedic character interactions.  (Krieg's "sane" inner-voice straight-manning himself just isn't enough to carry the tale.)

And, though less-so than [Bounty of Blood](game:Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood - A Fistful of Redemption), Fantastic Fustercluck similarly tries a little too hard for some "serious" story beats.  Krieg's heartache over Maya is borderline creepy, and his tragic origin story turns out to be a familiar psychotic-break trope.

This DLC also has a shockingly difficult final boss battle, considering how easy the rest of its encounters were.  (Though unlike in Claptastic Voyage, we did actually finish this one.)  Here's a combat design suggestion: when character options heavily feature "Kill Skills," buffing the player after each kill, you probably shouldn't make a boss fight that <i>has nothing to kill</i>.

Fantastic Fustercluck has a couple of cool ideas, particularly the segments in which you're chasing - and being chased by - a <b>psychedelic train</b> called Locomobius.  And, I mean, the core Borderlands shoot-and-loot gameplay still works just fine -- nothing wrong with that.

But it never really capitalizes on its ideas; including Locomobius, which just ends in a boss fight where you shoot at the train a bunch.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood - A Fistful of Redemption>, <game:Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Claptastic Voyage>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax>, <game:Borderlands 3: Guns, Love and Tentacles - The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock>  
<b>Krieg's tragic science-experiment backstory</b>: feels like it might have meant to hint at a broader "origins of the psychos" plot point; I'm not really sure why this DLC dug itself in so deep, there.
