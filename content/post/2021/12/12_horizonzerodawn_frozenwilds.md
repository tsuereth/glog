At least I was prepared for them, this time, and knew to focus hard on weak spots -- or just run the hell away.

At the end of the day, though, [The Frozen Wilds](game:Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds) is still ["more of the same" ... "but smaller."]($SiteBaseURL$2018/10/28/i-hate-these-fucking-fire-wolves/)

And while more Horizon certainly isn't bad - I had no trouble dumping hours upon hours into The Cut's objectives and collectibles - it simply doesn't measure up to the main game's high-points.

From a level-pacing perspective, I wish The Frozen Wilds fit more "alongside" the main game than "after" it.  After Zero Dawn's thrilling main narrative, this can't help but feel like a side-story.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna>

<b>Next time, Aloy, please don't</b>: add <i>even more</i> material types to an already overstuffed crafting inventory.

<i>Progress: 100% completion</i>
