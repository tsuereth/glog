A decade later, {{% game "Saints Row: The Third Remastered" %}}Saints Row: The Third Remastered{{% /game %}} still feels <b>pretty good</b>.

In many ways, it's surprising how ahead of its time {{% game "Saints Row: The Third" %}}the original release{{% /game %}} was.  From its character creator with gender-unlocked voice options and equal-opportunity genital sliders, to its unflinching embrace of anti-hero cynicism and moral neutrality; the Saints may be homicidal monsters but they're <i>likable</i>, and the game's <i>avant-garde</i> material still plays well in today's social climate.

(Arguably, its use of prostitutes in activities and as NPCs could be a little less sexist, i.e. it could use some <i>male whores</i>.  But the game is already pretty sex-positive!)

The open world of Steelport also remains a <i>blast</i> to cause trouble in, despite shoddy car handling and uneven aiming controls -- you can still suplex pedestrians, hijack cars by leaping through their windshields, and zap helicopters with a VTOL jet.  And those are what's important, after all.

"Taking over" the city is still a ton of fun, even though modern sandbox expectations make Steelport's list of activities feel a little lacking.  Between formula re-use - like, Snatch and Escort are pretty damn similar - and an overall low <i>number</i> of optional objectives; plus how hidden and confusing the Assassination and Vehicle Theft diversions are... I mean, I still enjoyed coloring Steelport purple, but its side-content is a far cry from {{% game "Ghost of Tsushima" %}}Tsushima{{% /game %}}'s or even {{% game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition" %}}Skyrim{{% /game %}}'s.

And there are some opportunities for gameplay polish that, I think, maybe this remaster could have taken -- like the radio's small track list, missions that take too long inbetween checkpoints, the high cost of endgame upgrades (and/or the tedium of accumulating cash), and how mobs of enemies can sometimes grow into an infuriatingly large swarm (especially in the zombie mission).

So, sure, time hasn't left Saints Row: The Third in <i>quite</i> the shape I recall from 2011.  But it still holds up pretty damn well, it's still <i>fun</i> and <i>crazy</i>, and the remaster has it looking gorgeous even by modern standards.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Agents of Mayhem" %}}Agents of Mayhem{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered" %}}Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Saints Row IV" %}}Saints Row IV{{% /game %}}, I just honestly miss running up buildings like a superhero.  
<b>I don't care if they drop Shaundi, and Johnny Gat, et al</b>: in the {{% game "Saints Row (2022)" %}}upcoming reboot{{% /game %}} -- Volition just needs to recapture this sense of zany fun, and fill the new map with hectic, destructive activities.

<i>Progress: 98%, conquered Steelport.</i>
