While <game:Saints Row: The Third Remastered> was a pleasant reminder of Volition's madcap sandbox formula, replaying its DLCs was a more sobering trip back in time; the DLC standards of yester-decade were pretty insubstantial.

[Genkibowl VII](game:Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII)'s new activities are <i>fine</i>, but there aren't many of them, and most aren't sufficiently distinct from the core game's side-missions.  (Skyblazing, at least, feels pretty fresh.)

[Gangstas in Space](game:Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space) is a funny, but short, mini-story -- its sense of humor dulled by some frustrating die-and-retry checkpointing.

... and the same goes for [The Trouble with Clones](game:Saints Row: The Third - The Trouble with Clones), whose humor feels like more of a reach.  The Saints Flow super-power mission was <i>neat</i> ten years ago, but now just makes me want to replay <game:Saints Row IV>.

At full running lengths of 1-2 hours apiece, these content packs all feel insubstantial and easy to miss.  At least they're no longer an additional charge, I guess.
