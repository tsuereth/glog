For the most part, {{% game "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles" %}}The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles{{% /game %}} - the localized collection of two games, {{% game "The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures" %}}Adventures{{% /game %}} and {{% game "The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve" %}}Resolve{{% /game %}}, which I {{% abslink href="2014/04/26/oh-great/" %}}thought would never leave Japan{{% /abslink %}} - is exactly what an {{% tag "Ace Attorney" %}}Ace Attorney{{% /tag %}} veteran expects.

From its outlandish, boisterous characters...

{{% absimg src="greataceattorney_swanhat.jpg" width="640" height="360" %}}

To the protagonist's fish-out-of-water attitude and haphazard trial technique.

{{% absimg src="greataceattorney_lookofterror.jpg" width="640" height="360" %}}

Even the awkwardness in its PC port, like nonsense keybindings, and this baffling dependency/codec error:

{{% absimg src="greataceattorney_whatcodec.png" width="243" height="141" %}}

... is, well, {{% abslink href="2020/05/16/stride-off/" %}}within expectations for Capcom{{% /abslink %}}.

Great Ace Attorney may take place in a different era, and a different hemisphere, but friends of Phoenix and Maya will get along with Ryunosuke and Susato just fine.

Like {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy" %}}Phoenix's{{% /game %}} (and {{% game "Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney" %}}Apollo's{{% /game %}}) stories, this one is both fun and dramatic -- building up an enchanting cast of characters, like the absent-minded Sherl- er, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture_references_to_Sherlock_Holmes">Herlock Sholmes</a> and the panicky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki">Soseki Natsume</a>; while simultaneously uncovering a deep backstory riddled with intrigue and <i>pathos</i>.

{{% absimg src="greataceattorney_hallowedchalice.jpg" width="640" height="360" %}}

The pacing of some cases is a bit "off," especially when the first game ends with major plot questions unanswered, and the second game then <i>flashes back</i> to add <i>more</i> questions on top.  And, some earlier cases can feel quite slow -- <i>lots</i> of dialog to click through.

But ultimately, when the final cases bring everything together, Ryunosuke's tale is a thoroughly entertaining and satisfying one.

The gameplay is, well, it does the job.  Investigating scenes, and picking apart testimonies, work the same as ever; evidence can be rotated and poked at in 3D, like in {{% game "Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney" %}}Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney{{% /game %}}, although this game's (era-appropriate) scene investigation tools are less varied.

Great Ace Attorney reuses the multi-witness mechanic from {{% game "Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney" %}}Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney{{% /game %}}, but - as in its predecessor - this doesn't really change the flow of witness testimony.

And while Great Ace Attorney also adds a "Dance of Deduction" mechanic (logically deducing the scene with Sholmes) as well as a "Jury Summation Examination" mechanic (interviewing jurors to flip their rulings), they are - in practice - exactly like examining evidence and pressing witnesses.  At least the Sholmes segments include some over-the-top choreography and finger-snapping.

(The first game also includes some content that's suggestive of a {{% platform "3DS" %}}3DS{{% /platform %}}-specific stereoscopy feature; in this 2021 re-release, the game asks you to cross your eyes while looking at two images.)

{{% absimg src="greataceattorney_stereoscope.jpg" width="640" height="360" %}}

So, at its worst, the Great Ace Attorney duology doesn't innovate on its franchise's "visual novel with detective elements" foundation.  And can move a bit slowly.

But these characters are enjoyable, and this story is fulfilling -- from its grandest aristocratic scandal to its <a href="https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Wagahai">tiniest pun</a>.  This collection is worthy of the name Ace Attorney.
