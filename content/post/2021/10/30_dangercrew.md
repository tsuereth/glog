<game:Danger Crew>, a turn-based RPG themed around computer programming and tech culture, is a cute idea -- and not much more.

It's neat that an attack called <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> steals (<tt>GET</tt>s) an item from the enemy; and it's fun that NPC dialog lampoons tropes like "everyone has a startup," and "<a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/why-coding-interviews-still-suck-aa189e3b6c93">interviews are a nightmare</a>."

But the <i>facade</i> is generally thin, and the game underneath it is fairly rote.

The combat mechanics aren't really special: your HP is "battery charge," you attack with "scripts," and items can buff attributes like offense or defense or accuracy.  Nor is the top-down overworld remarkable, just more of the same grid-based navigation that RPGs have done for the past 35 or 40 years.

And that'd be fine if the game's <i>writing</i> was more distinctive, but... too many opportunities for immersive flavor text get squandered (pro tip: computer code doesn't use literal wires):

And mission dialogs just read like an excuse to make you walk the map and do battles (another pro tip: don't put an ongoing meeting "on hold" while waiting for the new guy to finish his office tour):

... granted, poorly-planned meetings are actually kinda realistic.

I like the idea!  But the execution isn't deep or thorough enough.  Danger Crew feels like nothing more than a stripped-down RPG with some <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired articles</a> pasted on top.

<i>Progress: Level 6, didn't start the meeting yet.</i>
