{{% game "NERTS! Online" %}}NERTS{{% /game %}} reminded me that there was a recent Zachtronics game I hadn't caught up with yet; and while it may not have any programming puzzles, {{% game "Eliza (2019)" %}}Eliza (2019){{% /game %}} is still <i>definitely</i> a Zachtronics game.

Not because its art style and soundtrack are so highly reminiscent of {{% game "Exapunks" %}}Exapunks{{% /game %}} - though they are - or because it has another infuriating solitaire minigame.  But because its story is so innately and thoroughly <i>a programmer's story</i>.  From the grandiose ambitions and all-night crunch sessions to the slimy venture capitalists and ultimately transparent products, Eliza is just as good as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/">HBO's <i>Silicon Valley</i></a> at capturing the often-uncomfortable realities of the software industry.

Eliza leverages those realities to tell a pretty compelling story in a truly believable context.  On its surface this may look like a cautionary tale about the power of artificial intelligence, but I'd argue the "real" story is more about its human characters: the wide-eyed junior engineers getting taken advantage of by purse-string-holders, the industry veterans burning out and losing their passion, and the <i>users</i> who naively think this technology will improve their lives.

The game is far from perfect, even in terms of a pure storytelling experience -- character art quality is inconsistent, voice-overs are conspicuously absent from inner-voice thoughts, and choices don't seem to matter at all until the very end of the game.  And, though I assume there are many ending alternatives, the one I chose was pretty anti-climactic.

But Eliza <i>nails</i> its characterizations, putting its cast in just the right situations to showcase their relatable quirks and compelling foibles.  And its voice work is on-point, reinforcing those characterizations with believable, emotive acting.

Eliza's story isn't the best I've played, visual novel or otherwise.  But its writing and voice-acting make it feel substantial, and worthwhile.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Analogue: A Hate Story" %}}Analogue: A Hate Story{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Gone Home" %}}Gone Home{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney" %}}Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney{{% /game %}}  
<b>Now I really hope</b>: That the next Zachtronics puzzle game has this level of narrative commitment.
