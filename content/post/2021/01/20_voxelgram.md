[The demo]($SiteBaseURL$2020/02/09/now-youre-thinking-with-voxels/) sold me, and <game:Voxelgram>'s full game did not disappoint.

It's got a significant amount of built-in content, even without its user-generated Steam Workshop puzzles.  Its later puzzles build up to a considerable size and feel really satisfying to complete.  It's overall well-polished, with clear hints, convenient controls, and the good sense to highlight your errors while not <i>penalizing</i> you for them.

And it's got at least one quality-of-life feature that I've never seen before: "Load valid state," an effective and forgiving escape hatch for those times when you know you've made a mistake ... somewhere.  Instead of restarting the whole damn puzzle, you can use the [sands of time](game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) to rewind your error and get back to puzzling.

Voxelgram is a solidly-built, content-full, easy-to-play puzzle game that also happens to have 50% more spatial dimensions than most nonogram games.  That's an easy "win" for me.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Paint it Back>, <game:Picross 3D>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Pictopix>  
<b>But what it really needs is</b>: some [RPG elements](game:PictoQuest: The Cursed Grids)!  Or maybe a [visual novel storyline](game:Murder by Numbers) ... do I play too many nonogram games?  <i>Nahhhh</i>.

<i>Progress: Finished all 196 diorama puzzles.</i>
