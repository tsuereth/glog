{{% abslink href="2020/02/09/now-youre-thinking-with-voxels/" %}}The demo{{% /abslink %}} sold me, and {{% game "Voxelgram" %}}Voxelgram{{% /game %}}'s full game did not disappoint.

It's got a significant amount of built-in content, even without its user-generated Steam Workshop puzzles.  Its later puzzles build up to a considerable size and feel really satisfying to complete.  It's overall well-polished, with clear hints, convenient controls, and the good sense to highlight your errors while not <i>penalizing</i> you for them.

And it's got at least one quality-of-life feature that I've never seen before: "Load valid state," an effective and forgiving escape hatch for those times when you know you've made a mistake ... somewhere.  Instead of restarting the whole damn puzzle, you can use the {{% game "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" %}}sands of time{{% /game %}} to rewind your error and get back to puzzling.

Voxelgram is a solidly-built, content-full, easy-to-play puzzle game that also happens to have 50% more spatial dimensions than most nonogram games.  That's an easy "win" for me.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Paint it Back" %}}Paint it Back{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Picross 3D" %}}Picross 3D{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Pictopix" %}}Pictopix{{% /game %}}  
<b>But what it really needs is</b>: some {{% game "PictoQuest" %}}RPG elements{{% /game %}}!  Or maybe a {{% game "Murder by Numbers" %}}visual novel storyline{{% /game %}} ... do I play too many nonogram games?  <i>Nahhhh</i>.

<i>Progress: Finished all 196 diorama puzzles.</i>
