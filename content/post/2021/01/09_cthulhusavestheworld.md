<game:Cthulhu Saves the World> is not without charm.  It wastes no time breaking - really, <i>demolishing</i> - its own fourth wall, and its writing and art shows how much fun the game must've been to make.

{{% absimg src="cthulhusavestheworld.jpg" width="400" height="300" %}}

But inbetween its silly dialogs is an RPG that's not only basic, but <b>archaic</b>.  "Basic" isn't necessarily bad, especially since it means combat flows fairly quickly, but it also means lots of throwaway random encounters with low-effort monsters, and barren, bland environments between points of interest.

And by "archaic" I mean stuff like... there's no inventory screen, so when you pick up weapons or armor, you need to know (or guess) which party member can equip it, then go into the equipment sub-sub-menu for that character to see said weapon or armor.

I may have lamented that <game:Cosmic Star Heroine> was "unfinished", but at least what it <i>did</i> finish was more user-friendly than Cthulhu's head-scratching menus, and more satisfying than Cthulhu's makework combat and map traversal.
