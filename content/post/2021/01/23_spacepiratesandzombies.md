<game:Space Pirates and Zombies> is an unambiguous attempt to rekindle the system-hopping, Newtonian-physics, do-missions-to-earn-cash-to-upgrade-ships charm of older games like <tag:Escape Velocity>.  More so than modern reinterpretations like <game:Rebel Galaxy>, this is essentially the <i>same game</i>, hewing even closer to decades-old interfaces and mechanics than <game:3030 Deathwar Redux> did.

... but unfortunately, combat - which Space Pirates embraces as its central form of gameplay - is painfully un-fun.  The controls are just as clunky as this game's now-archaic ancestors: selecting enemy targets is awkward, and aiming line-of-sight weapons at them is an annoying pain.  That aiming frustration is amplified by the fact that enemy AI loves to run away, often leading to tedious cat-and-mouse chases.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> make frequent mention of the fact that grinding through combat missions (including randomly-generated ones) makes up a majority of the game's running length.

It's a shame, because I like a lot of what Space Pirates has assembled <i>around</i> its combat, especially the early introduction of fleet management -- I love the idea of upgrading not only my own ship, but an <i>entourage</i> of ships with which to storm into a system and wreck up the place.  If only that "wrecking up" was any fun to do.

<i>Progress: Finished the tutorial missions.</i>
