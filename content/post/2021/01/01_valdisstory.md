<game:Hollow Knight> recently left me itching for "more Metroidvania," and <game:Valdis Story: Abyssal City> ... did not help.

Its <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Valdis_Story:_Abyssal_City#Video_settings">awkward screen size</a> and poorly-written story are both off-putting, though not deal-breakers.  Input-handling feels a little loose, but Valdis Story's bigger problem is that the controls <i>don't make sense</i>, due to both poor tutorialization (I had to read the online manual to figure out what Focus is) and counter-intuitive button mapping.

In the air, pressing Down performs a stomp move.  On the ground, Down is an <i>animation cancel</i> and also a necessary precursor to dodging -- like, to dodge left, you press Down and then Left.  There are so many unused buttons, and so many other games have the sense to implement <i>a dodge button</i>; why, why would you do it this way?

The game's also got a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=285679883">style ranking system</a>, which might be a "plus" to action/fighting folks, but to me is just a punishment for not adapting to those bizarre controls.

What little of Valdis Story I saw was somewhat promising re: other 'vania qualities, like a sprawling world map with just-out-of-reach alternate routes, and character progression through level-ups and equipment crafting.  But learning <i>how to play</i> the game looks like more work than I'm willing to put into it.

<i>Progress: Got to the second boss.</i>
