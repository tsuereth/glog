I was a fan of <game:Overlord>'s and [Raising Hell](game:Overlord: Raising Hell)'s sense of humor, in spite of some underwhelming gameplay.  Coming back to <game:Overlord II> a decade later is a stark reminder of those {{% abslink href="2009/09/09/overlord-6/" %}}"in spite of" problems{{% /abslink %}}: uninspired level design, uneven objective clarity, and confounding controls -- multiplexing minion direction with camera movement is a clear design flaw.

And the franchise's cartoony anti-hero humor doesn't really cut it anymore.  I mean, to put a point on it, in a post-<game:Saints Row IV> marketplace Overlord's tone just isn't very impactful.
