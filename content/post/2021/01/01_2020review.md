Well, we made it.  <i>Phew.</i>

Aside from the ... everything, 2020 was actually a great year for the Glog.  In January I resolved to aggressively tackle my backlog, and I ended up doing a damned good job of it; a couple more years like this might actually clear it out!

Last year saw the second-highest number of games Glogged since I started counting -- and that's only the number of games I "bothered" to write about.

I don't have a firm count of how many I gave up on without a post, but I will say ... the scroll bar on my Steam library is getting pretty confident in itself.

The dark side of backlog-busting is that many of those games sat unplayed for a reason - more on that in a bit - and, for palate-cleansing purposes, my 2020 gaming also included a significant amount of replaying old favorites.

<game:Grand Theft Auto IV> / [Ballad of Gay Tony](game:Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony) / [V](game:Grand Theft Auto V), <game:Batman: Arkham Origins> / [Asylum](game:Batman: Arkham Asylum) / [City](game:Batman: Arkham City) / [Harley Quinn's Revenge](game:Batman: Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge) / [Knight](game:Batman: Arkham Knight), and [Uncharted 2](game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves) / [3](game:Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception) / [4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End) / [Lost Legacy](game:Uncharted: The Lost Legacy) account for the bulk of said replays.

Plus some brief trips back to <game:VVVVVV> for its tenth anniversary; <game:Prince of Persia (2008)> which has been officially demoted out of "old favorite" status; and <game:Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance> which was really more of a "re-attempt" (though not much of one).

But I also found time for a fair number of demos last year, and some of them were even good!  Don't be surprised to read more about the full versions of <game:Voxelgram>, [Batbarian](game:Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials), <game:Raji: An Ancient Epic>, and <game:Midnight Protocol> in the future.

On that note, it was very satisfying to see Steam evangelizing demos in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SteamGameFestival-Spring">Spring</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/gamefestival">Summer</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamgamefestival">Autumn Game Festival</a> events.  I really hope that this trend continues after in-person game conventions have resumed.

As for DLC and expansion activity, those replays ended up feeding a big chunk of it...

... between the aforementioned Ballad of Gay Tony, Harley Quinn's Revenge, and Lost Legacy replays.  Last year also saw my <i>first</i> playthroughs of some Batman DLCs, specifically the better-than-expected [Cold, Cold Heart](game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart), the <i>worse</i>-than-expected [A Matter of Family](game:Batman: Arkham Knight - A Matter of Family), and the pretty-much-just-as-expected [Season of Infamy: Most Wanted Expansion](game:Batman: Arkham Knight - Season of Infamy: Most Wanted Expansion).

The remainder of my DLCs last year were <game:Fallout 4>'s, namely [Automatron](game:Fallout 4: Automatron), [Vault-Tec Workshop](game:Fallout 4: Vault-Tec Workshop), [Far Harbor](game:Fallout 4: Far Harbor), and [Nuka World](game:Fallout 4: Nuka World) ... that last one <i>thoroughly</i> wearing out the game's welcome.  Bethesda's proliferation of DLC packs is a case study in what happens when you <i>don't</i> "leave them wanting more."

Around now is where I would normally chart my cross-platform game activity, excluding the always-unfairly-advantaged <platform:PC> -- normally, that is, but last year I only played on <i>one</i> other platform (<platform:PS4>) and most of that was replaying Uncharted.

My one non-PC, non-replay game of 2020 was the <game:Final Fantasy VII Remake> demo, which I was side-eyeing even before full-game reviews started to explain <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2020/04/22/final-fantasy-7-remake-ending-explained-sequel/">how weird it gets</a>.

Now, a few paragraphs ago, I said that the "dark side" of spelunking into my backlog was that many games were there "for a reason."  If I was being generous, I could say the reason was that they didn't quite stand out from their competitors; but if I was being <i>real</i>, I'd say that many just <i>weren't good</i>.

My game ratings for 2020 were significantly biased toward "No Rating" (which sometimes just means I'm being polite) and <rating:Meh>, with a record-low proportion of <rating:Good> or <rating:Awesome> ratings.

Excluding replays, the only games I counted as Awesome were <game:Pictopix> (so many puzzles!) and <game:Factorio> (so many conveyor belts!).

There were some stand-out Good games, for sure, like <game:Headlander>, <game:The Turing Test>, <game:Murder by Numbers>, <game:Dishonored: Death of the Outsider>, <game:Iconoclasts>, <game:Masquerada: Songs and Shadows>, ... and <game:Hollow Knight>, which might be my "most memorably good" game of the year (like <game:Indivisible> before it).

I'll even admit - yes, <i>admit</i> - that <game:Fallout 4> was good, and enjoyable, and sometimes captivating, despite how much I've ranted (and will surely rant in the future) about its various transgressions.

Lately, though, I've been seriously contemplating how [2018 <i>spoiled</i> me]($SiteBaseURL$2019/01/01/2018-in-review-the-future-is-soon/) with [God of War](game:God of War (2018)), <game:Horizon Zero Dawn>, and of course <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt>.  It's frankly hard to judge other games as "Awesome" in a post-Geralt world.

That said, many of the games that disappointed me in 2020 have no one to blame but themselves.  <game:Dishonored 2> and (especially) <game:Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus> failed to live up to the expectations set by their predecessors.  <game:3030 Deathwar Redux>, <game:Cosmic Star Heroine>, and <game:Dex> were all victims of out-sized ambitions, and under-delivered on their core loops.  <game:Undertale> had some great ideas, like, <i>I get it</i>, but the game itself was clunky and boring.

<game:Furi> definitely wasn't for me.  I think it might be for people who really hate themselves.

And I feel I have to make a note, for the record, on [Baldur's Gate](game:Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition), [Planescape: Torment](game:Planescape: Torment - Enhanced Edition), and [Divinity: Original Sin](game:Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced Edition).  Between these three heavy-hitters of the classically-styled CRPG, 2020 was the year I finally realized that I'm <i>not into</i> this sub-genre.

Which has helped shape my gaming plans for the year ahead, <i>vis-a-vis</i> what portions of my backlog to focus on.  As did <game:Cyberpunk 2077>'s <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-to-get-your-cyberpunk-2077-refund-2020-12-18">wet fart of a launch</a>, such that I know my inevitable trip to Night City is still several months away.

Some <game:Borderlands 3> DLCs might be part of my 2021 plan, too.  And I've still got to get around to <game:Red Dead Redemption 2>, and so, so many others in [that backlog]($SiteBaseURL$backlog/).  But I think I'm catching up...!

One last footnote: with Factorio 1.0 launched, and <game:A.N.N.E.> being about as complete as it's likely to get, I think I'm finally, <i>finally</i> done [waiting on crowdfunded games]($SiteBaseURL$2018/01/21/early-access-late-release/).  That's kind of a milestone, right?
