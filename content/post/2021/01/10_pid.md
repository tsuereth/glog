{{% game "Pid" %}}Pid{{% /game %}} lives in a space between heavily-atmospheric walk-to-the-right games like {{% game "Inside (2016)" %}}Inside (2016){{% /game %}} and tactical run-and-jump platform games like {{% tag "Mario" %}}Mario{{% /tag %}} side-scrollers.  It's "more game-y" than the former category, as in, its imaginative environments are usually overshadowed by platforms to traverse and enemies to avoid or destroy.

But it's also not as well-polished as a Mario-tier game: the physics don't quite feel intuitive or predictable, and there is an awkward economy of collecting stars to buy ... consumable equipment? which rarely seems useful or relevant.

While it <i>tries</i> to set itself apart with some surreal backgrounds and that peculiar inventory system, Pid ultimately spends too much time feeling like just another platform game that doesn't measure up to the genre's standard-bearers.
