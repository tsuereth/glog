<game:Mass Effect>'s Mako tank sections were <i>so bad</i>, that <game:Mass Effect 2>'s launch-day content didn't have <i>any</i> driving sections.  I'd argue that it should have stayed that way.  Alas...

The [Firewalker Pack](game:Mass Effect 2: Firewalker Pack) adds a small handful of missions where you pilot the Hammerhead hover-tank, and if you think the word "hover" makes that sound cool, just, simmer down and remember the Mako for a moment.

Conceptual coolness aside, the Hammerhead is not fun to use.  It hovers about as well as a tumbleweed, getting stuck on terrain almost as often as a <i>non-hovering</i> tank would; its mission objectives are limited to remedial strafe-around-stationary-targets combat, and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThroughTheRings">tediously flying through nav markers</a>; and the narrative backing for these missions is a lazy throwaway side-plot about researchers finding a wholly-unremarkable Prothean ruin.

It speaks volumes that <game:Mass Effect 3> <i>never</i> got driving sections.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Fallout 4: Automatron>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky> (which, honestly, had more interesting mechanics in one mission than Firewalker had in five)  
<b>The Hammerhead also features in</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord>, and isn't great there, either; but at least <i>something interesting</i> happens in that story.
