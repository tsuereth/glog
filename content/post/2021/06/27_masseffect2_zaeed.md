When, mere minutes ago, I effused about the quality of {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}Mass Effect 2{{% /game %}}'s character-centric storytelling, there was an <i>implied asterisk</i>.  The {{% game "Mass Effect Legendary Edition" %}}Legendary Edition{{% /game %}} package was my first run with DLC character {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge" %}}Zaeed{{% /game %}}, and he <b>sucks</b>.

Not in gameplay terms - I mean, as a soldier, he seems fine I guess? - but his "grizzled old mercenary" personality never evolves past a flat stereotype; his backstory-revealing mission is narratively and mechanically uninteresting; and his conversations with Shepard aren't really complete.

I should be clear: when Shepard talks with other crew members, they often <i>both</i> talk, <i>to each other</i>.  In contrast, Zaeed mostly talks <i>at</i> you.  (Spoiler alert, so does {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory" %}}Kasumi{{% /game %}}.)

Mass Effect 2 is at its best when you're learning more about its characters and probing them for fun reactions.  Zaeed is ... not Mass Effect 2 at its best.

It's not that he or his loyalty mission are "bad" -- they're just <i>bland</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" %}}Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky" %}}Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax" %}}Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax{{% /game %}}  
<b>If the Collectors had forced me to sacrifice a crew member</b>: it definitely would have been Zaeed.
