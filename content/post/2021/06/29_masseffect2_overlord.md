<game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord> is a strangely ambitious DLC pack, and while it makes admirable attempts at several mold-breaking innovations, I wouldn't really say that they paid off.

It's got a mostly self-contained story, for one thing, a story which ultimately reaches a pretty fascinating conclusion <i>without</i> leaning on Shepard or the Reapers or other established lore.  ... however, up <i>until</i> that conclusion, plot development is scant and slow.  The premise is genuinely good, but it just isn't well-integrated with Overlord's early and middle missions.

Partly because - and here's another surprise - those missions can be tackled in any order, across a free-roaming planet map.  Like <game:Uncharted: The Lost Legacy>'s Western Ghats level, Overlord feels like an <i>experimental taste</i> of non-linear sandbox world design, using the new Hammerhead hover-tank to physically travel between missions at your own discretion.

This new approach is definitely promising, and probably helped inspire <game:Mass Effect: Andromeda>, for whatever that's worth.  But here, it's very prototype-y and under-done: secondary objectives and interesting scenery are both sparse, and so the illusion of openness breaks down pretty quickly.  Plus, [the Hammerhead kinda sucks](game:Mass Effect 2: Firewalker Pack).

And then there are the missions themselves, which you can tell are <i>really trying</i> to do new things that Mass Effect players haven't seen before; but when those things are a tile-sliding puzzle that's almost solved already, or a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">draw-the-enemy's-fire</a> encounter that can kill you in one shot, they just ... aren't very whelming.  One could even call them <i>under</i>whelming.

Overlord gets some credit for bold new ideas, but it doesn't take any of those ideas <i>far</i> enough to compete with the main game's excellent content.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart>  
<b>Spoiler alert, there is a satisfying throwback to Overlord</b>: in <game:Mass Effect 3>, but ... I'll have more to say about "throwbacks in ME3" later.
