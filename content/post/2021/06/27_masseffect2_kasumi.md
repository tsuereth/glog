Like [Zaeed](game:Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge), DLC character [Kasumi](game:Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory) really doesn't measure up to <game:Mass Effect 2>'s other party members.

Her backstory is a <i>little</i> more nuanced, although it doesn't really bear fruit until [the next game](game:Mass Effect 3).  And her loyalty mission is a <i>little</i> more engaging, although still not as exciting as a "rich party heist" feels like it could've been.

But crucially, Kasumi's conversations with Shepard are mostly one-sided, and her story includes only a couple minutes' worth of character development.

For a "master thief," Kasumi is pretty boring.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart>  
<b>I'd still push Zaeed out the airlock first</b>: but if I had to sacrifice <i>two</i> crew members...
