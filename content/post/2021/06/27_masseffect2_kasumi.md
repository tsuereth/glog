Like {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge" %}}Zaeed{{% /game %}}, DLC character {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory" %}}Kasumi{{% /game %}} really doesn't measure up to {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}Mass Effect 2{{% /game %}}'s other party members.

Her backstory is a <i>little</i> more nuanced, although it doesn't really bear fruit until {{% game "Mass Effect 3" %}}the next game{{% /game %}}.  And her loyalty mission is a <i>little</i> more engaging, although still not as exciting as a "rich party heist" feels like it could've been.

But crucially, Kasumi's conversations with Shepard are mostly one-sided, and her story includes only a couple minutes' worth of character development.

For a "master thief," Kasumi is pretty boring.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge" %}}Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart" %}}Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart{{% /game %}}  
<b>I'd still push Zaeed out the airlock first</b>: but if I had to sacrifice <i>two</i> crew members...
