[Overlord](game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord) tried to tell an original side-story in Mass Effect's universe, but didn't ... try hard enough; really, none of <game:Mass Effect 2>'s DLCs felt like they "put in the effort."  [Omega](game:Mass Effect 3: Omega) shows what happens when DLC <i>does</i> put in the effort.  (It's good!)

Omega introduces a new supporting character, a new villain, and a couple new enemies, but the <i>real</i> star of this chapter is certified badass <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Aria_T\%27Loak">Aria</a>.  Throughout the multi-phased mission to retake the Omega station from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Admiral_Thrawn">Thrawn</a>-like Cerberus mastermind, Shepard and Aria get <i>plenty</i> of one-on-one time, and Carrie-Anne Moss delivers her character's cutthroat personality <i>so well</i>.

Aria was already a great "bad girl" archetype, but this DLC gives her a chance to really shine, like an animal backed into a corner; left with no choice but to claw her way out.

I wish the villain was a little more present throughout the story, and I wish that the mission was a little less linear -- or at least didn't trap me on Omega inbetween phases.  But that's a small sacrifice for this DLC chapter's tightly-scripted, well-paced, <i>satisfying</i> narrative.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge>, <game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty>, <game:Mass Effect 3: From Ashes>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart>, <game:Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep>  
<b>She may not be part of the Normandy crew</b>: but this definitely feels like "Aria's loyalty mission."
