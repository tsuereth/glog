[Leviathan](game:Mass Effect 3: Leviathan) taps into a theme that [Arrival](game:Mass Effect 2: Arrival) just hinted at: Reaper research leading to a <i>dark place</i>.  Leviathan takes that ball and runs with it all the way into cosmic horror, shades of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119081/">Event Horizon</a> territory.

So while it may not have the strong characterization of [Omega](game:Mass Effect 3: Omega), it's got <i>plenty</i> of intrigue and tension to go around.  The final mission is <i>masterful</i> in how it builds toward and reveals the mystery you've been chasing all along.

And the narrative payoff from this scene is one of the most memorable bits of the franchise.

Leviathan gets credit not only for adding meaningful background to Mass Effect's overall plot, but also for great pacing, scene-setting, visuals and voicework delivering a <i>dark</i> sci-fi thriller tale.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 3: From Ashes>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect 3: Omega>  
<b>Seriously</b>: Leviathan's lore revelations enrich the entire Mass Effect story.
