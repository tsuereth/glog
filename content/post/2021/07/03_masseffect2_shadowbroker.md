Unlike {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" %}}Overlord{{% /game %}}, the {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" %}}Lair of the Shadow Broker{{% /game %}} DLC story sticks closely to existing Mass Effect lore.

In fact, it's part of the setup for {{% game "Mass Effect 3" %}}Mass Effect 3{{% /game %}}, showing how Liara went from <i>investigating</i> the Shadow Broker to <i>being</i> the Shadow Broker.  And that's about it.

The mission starts with some intrigue, Liara going dark and Shepard following her trail ... but it isn't long before you're just mowing down wave after wave of goons on your way to the Shadow Broker's, uh, lair.

Ultimately this DLC's story feels like a two minute cutscene stretched into two hours of gameplay.  While that gameplay isn't "bad," per se, it's unremarkable; more of the same stuff you're already doing in Mass Effect 2.

And since "Liara is the Shadow Broker" is such a <i>minor</i> plot point in the third game, this DLC's narrative payoff doesn't end up feeling very meaningful.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge" %}}Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory" %}}Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory{{% /game %}}  
<b>Meeting a <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Yahg">Yahg</a> was pretty neat</b>: now I'm disappointed that they didn't play a bigger part in the series.
