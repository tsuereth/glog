Of <game:Mass Effect 3>'s two "new" squadmates, only one of them (the annoying one) was included in the main package.  The [From Ashes](game:Mass Effect 3: From Ashes) DLC introduces Javik, a revived Prothean!, whose unexpectedly harsh personality makes for highly entertaining conversation.

Asshole business decision, putting "the interesting one" behind a $10 additional purchase.  But now, after being thoroughly underwhelmed by [one](game:Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky), [two](game:Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge), [three](game:Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory), [four](game:Mass Effect 2: Firewalker Pack), [five](game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord), [six](game:Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker), <i>[seven](game:Mass Effect 2: Arrival)</i> Mass Effect DLCs in a row, I'm finally thankful for their inclusion in <game:Mass Effect Legendary Edition>.

The thing I <i>loved</i> about <game:Mass Effect 2> was getting to know its diverse cast of insane characters, and Javik is the closest Mass Effect 3 comes to rekindling that magic.  He reveals fascinating story details about the previous galactic cycle; he has a compellingly tragic backstory all his own; and Liara's reactions to his no-nonsense, imperialistic quips are <i>priceless</i>.

It's a shame that Mass Effect 3 doesn't have character loyalty missions, because Javik's probably would have been pretty great.  But he's still fun to have a conversation with, much more so than Zaeed or Kasumi were.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day>, <game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax>  
<b>For some <i>really</i> fun crew banter</b>: bring Javik and Wrex along for the [Citadel](game:Mass Effect 3: Citadel) DLC.  But I'm getting ahead of myself!
