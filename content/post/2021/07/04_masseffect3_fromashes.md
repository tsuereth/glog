Of {{% game "Mass Effect 3" %}}Mass Effect 3{{% /game %}}'s two "new" squadmates, only one of them (the annoying one) was included in the main package.  The {{% game "Mass Effect 3: From Ashes" %}}From Ashes{{% /game %}} DLC introduces Javik, a revived Prothean!, whose unexpectedly harsh personality makes for highly entertaining conversation.

Asshole business decision, putting "the interesting one" behind a $10 additional purchase.  But now, after being thoroughly underwhelmed by {{% game "Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky" %}}one{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge" %}}two{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory" %}}three{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: The Firewalker Pack" %}}four{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" %}}five{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker" %}}six{{% /game %}}, <i>{{% game "Mass Effect 2: Arrival" %}}seven{{% /game %}}</i> Mass Effect DLCs in a row, I'm finally thankful for their inclusion in {{% game "Mass Effect Legendary Edition" %}}Mass Effect Legendary Edition{{% /game %}}.

The thing I <i>loved</i> about {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}Mass Effect 2{{% /game %}} was getting to know its diverse cast of insane characters, and Javik is the closest Mass Effect 3 comes to rekindling that magic.  He reveals fascinating story details about the previous galactic cycle; he has a compellingly tragic backstory all his own; and Liara's reactions to his no-nonsense, imperialistic quips are <i>priceless</i>.

It's a shame that Mass Effect 3 doesn't have character loyalty missions, because Javik's probably would have been pretty great.  But he's still fun to have a conversation with, much more so than Zaeed or Kasumi were.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" %}}Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" %}}Mass Effect 2: Overlord{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax" %}}Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax{{% /game %}}  
<b>For some <i>really</i> fun crew banter</b>: bring Javik and Wrex along for the {{% game "Mass Effect 3: Citadel" %}}Citadel{{% /game %}} DLC.  But I'm getting ahead of myself!
