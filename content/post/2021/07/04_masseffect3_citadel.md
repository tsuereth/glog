Here we are at last, the end of my {{% game "Mass Effect Legendary Edition" %}}Mass Effect Legendary Edition{{% /game %}} journey.  And the {{% game "Mass Effect 3: Citadel" %}}Citadel{{% /game %}} DLC, even more than {{% game "Mass Effect 3" %}}Mass Effect 3{{% /game %}}'s actual ending, wraps that journey up with a very satisfying bow.

There are two major phases to the Citadel DLC - a hectic cat-and-mouse mission pitting Shepard against <i>evil clone Shepard</i>, and ... an apartment party - both with the same "true" objective: reuniting you with the Mass Effect trilogy's cast of lovable misfits.

The somewhat-absurd premise of this DLC's combat missions is kicked <i>all the way</i> over the top by your squad's flippant, "fuck it" attitude toward evil-Shep.  (As I alluded to earlier, {{% game "Mass Effect 3: From Ashes" %}}Javik{{% /game %}} and Wrex get some great commentary in here.)  This content makes very clear that it isn't about saving the galaxy -- it's about bringing back old squad members and having some fun with them.

And then you get to invite all of Shepard's current and former squaddies to a big party.  For real.  This mission tasks you with <i>talking to your friends</i>, and listening to them banter back and forth, make fun of Vega, speculate about the nature of Joker and EDI's relationship, <i>et cetera</i>.

I missed my {{% game "Mass Effect 2" %}}Mass Effect 2{{% /game %}} allies throughout ME3's story, so I love that the Citadel party gave me a chance to "catch up with" them again.  And, with all due respect to the Reaper star-child and the galactic cycle... the <i>best</i> send-off for Shepard was definitely celebrating the friends she made along the way.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax" %}}Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax {{% /game %}} (also a reunion tour), {{% game "Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut" %}}Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut{{% /game %}} (the "real" ending of the game), {{% game "Mass Effect 3: Leviathan" %}}Mass Effect 3: Leviathan{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Mass Effect 3: Omega" %}}Mass Effect 3: Omega{{% /game %}}  
<b>I just wish</b>: I'd done the Citadel party before Mordin's sacrifice, so I could've invited him, too!  RIP you loquacious son of a bitch.
