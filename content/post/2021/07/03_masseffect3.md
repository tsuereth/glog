<game:Mass Effect 2> was <i>better</i> the second time around, because I knew what to expect and what I should focus on.  <game:Mass Effect 3>, in my [Legendary Edition](game:Mass Effect Legendary Edition) revisit, ... was not.  But it's still a fun adventure and ([now more than ever](game:Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut)) a satisfying conclusion to Shepard's story.

Some of Mass Effect's game systems have really improved in its third outing: snapping to cover is less error-prone, a "reputation" score allows you to benefit from mixing Paragon and Renegade decisions, and exploring the galaxy map is much less tedious (no resource scanning!).  Some other improvements are more debatable: hacking minigames have been removed entirely, and - as an Infiltrator, again - moving the time-slow buff from a character stat to a weapon upgrade is just confusing.

But there are other changes in Mass Effect 3 that are irrefutably for the worse.  Its plot structure is more linear, with more <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Side_mission_timing_guide">opportunities to miss content</a>.  Customization fatigue has <i>unnecessarily</i> regressed, with way too many weapon options and misleading stat sheets -- like, the fact that the <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Kishock_Harpoon_Gun">harpoon gun</a>'s projectiles have <i>travel time</i> isn't even a statistic!

And, most notably, ME3's squadmate roster is a significant downgrade from ME2's.  In pure numbers, we're down from 12 to a mere 7; and only two of those are "new" characters (and also, <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/James_Vega">Vega</a> is a shitty character).  And there are no loyalty missions at all!, or in other words, even this reduced cast has less one-on-one character development than the last game's crew.

... well, <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/EDI#Mass_Effect_3">EDI</a> develops, <i>not just physically but also emotionally</i>, from her Mass Effect 2 state.  But otherwise the most interesting characterization in Mass Effect 3 is when Shepard catches up with Grunt, Jack, Mordin, and Samara as NPCs in side-quests.

It feels great to finally bring the fight to the Reapers, and shooting alien monsters to death feels as good as it ever has.  But Mass Effect 3 still feels like a step back from its predecessor's non-linear mission structure and character-centric storytelling.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect>, any of the second game's DLCs.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2>, <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt>  
<b>And, as for <i>this</i> installment's DLC</b>: fewer in quantity, greater in quality!  But I'll talk more about those soon.

<i>Progress: Finished on Normal.</i>
