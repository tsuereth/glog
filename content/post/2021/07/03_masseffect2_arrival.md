[Arrival](game:Mass Effect 2: Arrival) starts small, with an innocent-sounding mission to rescue a covert operative, and takes a little too long building toward its major reveal: a plot to slow down the Reaper invasion by <i>fucking exploding a mass relay</i>.

Which threatens to be a really compelling side-story -- but is immediately interrupted by <s>space madness</s> indoctrination and a rushed-feeling series of fights before Shepard presses the "blow it up" button and calls it a day.

Arrival's ambitious plot is underserved by how little storytelling time it actually gets.  And while it's fun to observe the effects of this mission in <game:Mass Effect 3>, <i>re:</i> pissing off the batarians, I can't help but be disappointed that the angles of understanding and interfering with Reaper tactics are glossed over so quickly.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker>  
<b>All in all, despite a handful of cool ideas</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2>'s DLCs feel ... unnecessary, neither as compelling nor satisfying as the main game's character-centric missions.
