<i>Space casino robbery</i> is a strong pitch, and [Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot](game:Borderlands 3: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot) ... <i>partially</i> lives up to it.

It hits some high-value targets: a cool space-station aesthetic, filled with the same Hyperion loader bots that were so fun to blow up way back in <game:Borderlands 2>; a <i>cool</i> soundtrack, alternatingly jazzy and high-octane action-ey as it adapts to the DLC's varied environs; and hilarious character events, with cartoonishly irrevent and violent hijinks that can only be described as "Oh, <tag:Borderlands>."

But it also misses some prime opportunities squarely in its target area: the misfits you assemble into a crew don't get enough screentime to really shine - in particular, they don't bounce their awkward personalities off of one other, like any successful heist crew is obligated to do - and the villain is, well, not quite villainous enough.  Given that this DLC is built upon the legend of Handsome Jack, I feel like its big-bad should have done more to outgrow Jack's shadow.

I'll give them credit for trying to form plot points around <i>people stranded in the casino after Jack died</i> -- like, that's a powerful premise, and portions of the supporting cast deliver on it more strongly than I'd expect.  But, while surprisingly-entertaining segments like "Trashlantis" show interesting <i>ideas</i>, few of those segments are executed thoroughly enough to make them memorable on their own.

At the end of the day, the Handsome Jackpot is a really sweet setting for more Borderlands gameplay, which is pretty good.  I just wish that it was a better <i>caper</i>.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep>  
<b>Now I really want to watch</b>: a <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> and <i>Army of the Dead</i> fusion crime thriller.

<i>Progress: Finished the main quests, some but not all side-quests.</i>
