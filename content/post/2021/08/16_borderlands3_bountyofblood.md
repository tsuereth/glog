{{% game "Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood" %}}Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood{{% /game %}} commits what might be a cardinal sin, for {{% tag "Borderlands" %}}Borderlands{{% /tag %}}: it tries to tell a serious story.

I can definitely see what it was going for, with its "western but slightly different" aesthetic (bizarrely reminiscent of {{% game "Red Steel 2" %}}Red Steel 2{{% /game %}}), its narrator channeling a "truly gritty" tone of cynicism, and its attention-grabbing hook of (trivial spoiler) introducing you to the story's villain before you <i>find out</i> that she's the villain.

It's got some promising narrative starts -- the problem is that they never lead anywhere interesting.  None of the story's characters - not even the villain who you personally meet, nor her primary foil who you help throughout the story - are characterized for more than a second.  I <i>still</i> barely understand why Rose was doing what she did, and I never saw any consequential significance in the late-campaign revelation that {{% spoiler %}}"the company" who exploited and ruined this planet is Jakobs; like, does this affect our relationship with Wainwright? or the technology available in Jakobs weapons? or the balance of power among other weapons manufacturers?  No, it doesn't seem to mean anything.{{% /spoiler %}}

And it shouldn't be surprising that Bounty of Blood failed to deliver on its initial storytelling promises, because Borderlands has <i>almost never</i> done well with serious content -- including, recently and especially, the ending of Troy and Tyreen's story in {{% game "Borderlands 3" %}}Borderlands 3{{% /game %}}.

The whole game is built around moving fast and being a jerk.  That's why irrevent humor fits so well in it, and why serious moments only ever "land" when they're brief and straightforward interruptions to a sequence of hijinks.  Like we saw in {{% game "Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep" %}}Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep{{% /game %}}.  ... but I digress.

If there's anything redeeming in Bounty of Blood, it's that this DLC introduces - or reintroduces - some wacky gameplay twists like a melee-able bomb plant, {{% game "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" %}}The Pre-Sequel{{% /game %}}'s bounce pads (now in the form of ... also a plant), and {{% tag "Portal" %}}Portal{{% /tag %}}-esque teleporters.  But, even these mechanics are <i>used so rarely</i> that they barely impact any of Bounty of Blood's encounters.

And the loading screen art is pretty cool.  So, there's that.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" %}}Borderlands 2: How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax" %}}Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax{{% /game %}}  
<b>There <i>was</i> one bright spot of humor in this DLC campaign</b>: the story of "<a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Soapy_Steve">Soapy Steve</a>" is more memorable than anything else I saw in Bounty of Blood.

<i>Progress: Finished the main quests, almost no side-quests.</i>
