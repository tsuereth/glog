<game:Biped> seemed like a neat little co-op adventure when I started it back in January, but one frustrating level turned into a "break" that, six months later, it seems safe to assume won't get un-broken.

The game has a slick aesthetic, with simple and straightforward UI cues, and a colorful world that just plain "looks" fun.  And you can collect items to unlock cute hats!

But Biped's sweet and sugary looks belie some stressful coordination challenges -- as the game goes on, it asks for more and more-rapid synchronized actions between not just your own two hands, but also <i>someone else's</i> two hands <i>at the same time</i>.

It's not so harsh as <game:Kalimba>, but Biped still requires a level of shared-brain button-pressing precision that my partner and I just aren't going to get.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Kalimba>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime>  
<b>Definitely not as good as</b>: <game:Pitfall Planet>

<i>Progress: Finished "Rainy Ruins" in co-op.</i>
