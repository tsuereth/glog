[Guns, Love and Tentacles](game:Borderlands 3: Guns, Love and Tentacles - The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock) is something of a love letter to Lovecraftian horror, and the summary of that letter is: wow, Lovecraftian horror means a lot of weirdly different things.

It's got an icy planet in deep space, barren but for tentacle monsters.  It's got ancient evils who drop curses that drive people homicidally bonkers.  It's got a creeptastic New England-styled town that's always dark, and whose citizens are perpetually terrified of answering the door.  It's got an abandoned library built on top of a hidden laboratory concealing eldritch secrets.  It's got a detective-slash-demon-hunter who's too amnesiac to remember what he uncovered.

It's got, uh, vaguely Nordic barbarians who battle each other for sport.  (Was that ever a Lovecraft thing?  Maybe not.)

Anyway, it's got a lot.  And in attempting to do <i>all</i> of those things, <i>while</i> following the high-level plot of Sir Hammerlock and Wainwright Jakobs tying their knot, <i>and</i> gradually uncovering the tragic backstory of the villain who passed her curse along to them... it just doesn't get into enough depth with any of them to deliver especially well.

Gaige the Mechromancer (<game:Borderlands 2>) gives a great performance as an only-slightly overwhelmed wedding planner, especially when her companion Deathtrap helps you fight demons and cursed chumps.  And Mancubus, the <b>absolute creep-show</b> at the venue's front desk, is a genuine delight.  Otherwise, though, this DLC chapter's narrative chops don't really stand out.

What Guns, Love and Tentacles does <i>outside</i> its narrative is just fine, on balance with [Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot](game:Borderlands 3: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot) before it -- these environments are a little less varied, <i>but</i> there is a real hub level with vehicle traversal, so six of one and et cetera.

It's a fine DLC chapter with some fun trails to follow and monsters to blow up, just not as poignant or cohesive as some of Borderlands's best.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty>, <game:Borderlands 3: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot> (given my personal bias towards <i>space casino robbery</i>).  
<b>"Too many margs" Gaige</b>: is a pretty awesome character.  She and Mr. Torgue could do some real damage together.

<i>Progress: Finished the main quests, almost no side-quests.</i>
