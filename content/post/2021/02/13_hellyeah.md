It's one thing when <game:Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit>'s protagonist mocks his own game over having a [spindash move](tag:Sonic The Hedgehog).  It's another when the level is filled with pinball bumpers and self-propelling cannons.

<i>(Spoiler alert: watch me revisit the "borrows from others, with questionable results" theme once I finally write-up <game:Darksiders II>.)</i>

Hell Yeah isn't totally without a personality of its own, and in fact its flippant plot and nonsensical environments clear the way for some pretty clever level and enemy designs.  At least, clever <i>visual</i> designs.

But its <i>mechanics</i> are confusingly assembled from a variety of inspirations, usually without the contexts that made those inspirations meaningful; like a Frankenstein's monster of gameplay ideas that can grunt but hasn't figured out how to use its thumbs.

Take the saw-drill's ability to break through some materials -- you need new upgrades or abilities to get through new obstacles, kind-of like <tag:Metroid>'s progression-blocking doors.  Except Hell Yeah is a linear game with discrete levels, so there's barely any point to having these obstacles in the first place.

Or jumping, which is, you know, a pretty core part of a side-scrolling platform game; Hell Yeah's jumping physics are <i>crazy</i> floaty, and take a while to get used to.  Which makes it seem like a troll move when an early level takes the saw-drill away and <i>completely changes</i> the jumping physics out from under you.

Or the weapons that you can switch between - oh yeah, because this side-scrolling platformer is also a twin-stick shooter - of which almost all are a waste of a button-press.  Some weapons have consumable ammo, and you can even buy more weapons from the item shop!, but I've yet to see anything that out-performs the standard, infinite-ammo gatling gun.

And then there are the <tag:WarioWare>-styled micro-games that cap each boss fight -- which have satisfyingly-funny animations, but whose directions are often unclear; and since failing the micro-game damages you, it might even <i>kill</i> you and send you back to a pre-boss checkpoint, prompting you to re-think the decisions that have led to this moment in your life.

Oh, and I almost forgot about the "Island," a mobile-style idle minigame where you can assign jobs to the bosses you've defeated so far.  I almost forgot about it because, after the game introduced it, <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/662411-hell-yeah-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/64379563">I never saw it again</a> and it <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/662361-hell-yeah-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/64196267">had no effect on the real game</a>.

Hell Yeah isn't a bad game, not exactly, even if <i>parts</i> of it are certainly bad.  Overall it's not-intolerable, and there is some entertainment value in discovering more of the game's wild, wacky bosses.

Just, not enough value to merit the alternating-slog-and-sleepwalk that is Hell Yeah's hodge-podge gameplay.

<i>Progress: Finished the Mount Olympus Casino (?) level.</i>
