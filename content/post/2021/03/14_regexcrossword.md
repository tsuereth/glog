Sure, a <a href="https://regexcrossword.com/">website with some form fields</a> is a bit of a loose fit for this video game blog.  But <game:Regex Crossword> is an interactive experience that entertained me for most of the weekend ... and it compares favorably to <game:Copy Editor>.

Following a co-worker tip to <a href="http://jimbly.github.io/regex-crossword/">this harrowing puzzle</a>, I saw the same link posted to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/m3opih/regex_crossword/">/r/programming</a> and followed that trail to the Regex Crossword site.  <i>Of course</i> I did that standalone puzzle, too; but the Regex Crossword site is much more noteworthy.

The puzzles with bi-directional hints could get pretty annoying, and I swear that <i>some</i> puzzles could have had multiple solutions (more than one character fitting the row and column hints).  Especially in the Hamlet section, I got the feeling that quotation-based solutions weren't deterministically verified quite as thoroughly.

But those quibbles aside, Regex Crossword gave me a damned impressive amount of the very kind of logic puzzles I'm hungry for.

I didn't even get to the user-submitted puzzles, for fear of how deep <i>that</i> rabbit hole might go.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Copy Editor>, <game:Prime Mover>, <game:Puppy Cross>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Human Resource Machine>, <game:Murder by Numbers>  
<b>And it's hard to argue with</b>: free!

<i>Progress: Finished all the built-in puzzles.</i>
