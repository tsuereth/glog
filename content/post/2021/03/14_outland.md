<game:Outland>'s pitch of combining platform-action and bullet-hell mechanics - with color switching, <i>ala</i> <game:Ikaruga> - sounds pretty promising.  Until you remember that bullet-hell games necessarily enforce a specific <i>pace</i> to their action, and that waiting around for obstacles to move is one of the most boring parts of a platform game.

The result feels like an avoid-em-up with only occasional bursts of wall-jumping or sword-swinging.  "Combat," while it does involve learning and adapting to attack patterns, tends to be less about defeating an enemy and more about dodging it.  The pattern-handling can get especially tricky when an enemy is near environmental obstacles, or other enemy types ... or both.

Then there's the strangely counter-intuitive behavior of Outland's platforming mechanics.  Platforms are slippery, but you latch onto walls in an instant -- even when you didn't intend to.  You can fall off the bottom of a ladder, but can't climb off the top of one.  You can move horizontally while mid-air, but the fall speed is way too fast to reasonably re-calculate your landing point.

Like [Ori and the Blind Forest](game:Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition), Outland isn't "just" hard because of challenging scenario design, but also because it demands more precision that the game's controls really support.

There is a story in Outland, for some reason; a weak, trope-y justification for the Light and Dark color dynamic.  The plot definitely isn't intriguing enough to push the game forward.  Nor is the world's aesthetic, which despite the high-visibility Light and Dark elements, is mostly very bland.

I don't like pure bullet-hell games, and Outland is basically ... that, with an awkward platforming implementation bolted onto it.
