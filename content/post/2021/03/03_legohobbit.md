Let's pull this band-aid off quickly: {{% game "LEGO The Hobbit" %}}LEGO The Hobbit{{% /game %}} doesn't tell the entire <i>The Hobbit</i> story.  After the dwarves re-invade Erebor, and Smaug prepares to attack Lake-town, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_The_Hobbit_(video_game)#Cancelled_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies_DLC">the game just sort of... ends.</a>

This mark against the game is tempered by the fact that, like {{% game "LEGO The Lord of the Rings" %}}LEGO The Lord of the Rings{{% /game %}}, LEGO The Hobbit is practically a parody of the story anyway -- injecting pratfalls and cartoon humor (like Bombur spontaneously pulling out a turkey leg) into LEGO-styled cutscenes, backed by the movies' recorded dialog.

The story's truncation is <i>also</i> tempered by the fact that - let's be real - the Hobbit movie trilogy was hardly compelling on its own.  None of the events of this story measure up to the gravitas of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.

What makes LEGO The Hobbit compelling, then, is - again, like LEGO LotR - an <b>open-world Middle-earth</b> to play around in.  Granted Bilbo's map doesn't cover as much as Frodo's, but even without Mordor, the scale of this game is impressive; as is its amount of optional side-quest and platform-puzzle activities.

Its gameplay mechanics and core loops are familiar if you've played a {{% tag "LEGO" %}}LEGO{{% /tag %}} game before: collect studs to unlock items to collect more studs to unlock characters to ... <i>collect everything</i>.  And aside from character-specific abilities, these mechanics don't have a hell of a lot to do with Tolkien's world -- the dwarves have axes, Legolas has a bow, and Gandalf can fire magic missiles, so you'll need to switch to the proper character to take out particular obstacles.  It's not exactly rocket science.

But like I wrote {{% abslink href="2020/11/27/go-go-power-ninja/" %}}not long ago{{% /abslink %}} about another LEGO title, my enjoyment of these games has a lot to do with my attachment to the source material.  And even if this game doesn't add much to what worked about LEGO LotR, ... well, as with <i>The Hobbit</i> movies, I'll take any excuse to get lost in Middle-earth again.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "The LEGO Movie Videogame" %}}The LEGO Movie Videogame{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "LEGO The Lord of the Rings" %}}LEGO The Lord of the Rings{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor" %}}Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor{{% /game %}}  
<b>Unusually, includes original voice acting</b>: by the late <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000489/">Christopher Lee</a>, who narrates the introduction of each story mission.  RIP, white wizard.
