<game:Qora> is a side-scroller entry in the "Walking Simulator" genre.  Which I guess makes it a "Go Left or Right Simulator."

It's not without some charm: the story hooks are intriguing, the NPC dialog has a sense of humor, and the simple art style is adequately evocative.  Running through its screens and uncovering its strange, fantastical plot makes for a good 20 minutes of fun.

The problem is that Qora is actually an <i>hour</i> long.  It moves <i>so slow</i> -- and I mean that very literally.  <b>The movement speed is absurdly slow</b>, and occasional button-mashing obstacles don't help.

Qora would be a "Meh" if its milquetoast story elements moved along at a reasonable pace.  But the pervasive <i>slowness</i> of the game make it feel like a chore.  Despite how ultimately short it is; Qora should be much shorter.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Zoo Rampage>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Cube Escape: Paradox>  
<b>There are multiple endings?</b>: but I can't imagine plodding through Qora a second time.
