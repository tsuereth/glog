Back in 2018 I said that I was "really not interested in replaying" <game:Red Spider: Vengeance>, and that leaves me in an awkward, confusing spot with its prequel <game:Red Spider 2: Exiled>.  Because the opening minutes of this game are filled with character names and relationship references that I don't remember anymore.

Like, I remember that "Fatso" was a person in the first game.  Was he a good person or a bad person?  Was Lau supposed to be a crime lord, or big-wig in the police ... or a dirty cop?

It feels a lot like Red Spider 2 takes that pre-existing character knowledge for granted, because after only a few minutes I was totally lost.  I didn't know which lines of dialog were moving the plot forward, and which were lies from a character covering his tracks.  I didn't know what the plot relevancy and stakes were when someone referred to another character or a family name.

I'm not saying it's a bad story, but it is badly introduced, and failed to hook me 'cause it made no effort to re-familiarize me with its setting.

<i>Progress: about 10 minutes.</i>
