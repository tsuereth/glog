Not many 20-minute-long games impress me, but <game:What Never Was> did.

It takes place in a single room, and there are only three puzzles.  But!  It strikes an excellent balance between environmental storytelling and gameplay pacing.

The puzzles felt organically integrated into the story's easy-to-understand premise, the interactive elements tantalized me with their background-story flavor text, and the ending - while abrupt - was a really intriguing teaser for whatever follow-up the developer has in mind.

(I did skip through much of the spoken dialog while reading through the subtitles.  So maybe the writing was a bit wordy.)

This little freely-downloadable passion project shows incredible potential for a full-fledged puzzle adventure game.

<b>Better than</b>: [The Room](game:The Room (2012)) (the puzzle game, not the <i>cinematic masterpiece</i>)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mandagon>  
<b>Less content than, but arguably on quality par with</b>: <game:Gone Home>
