It looks like something in the vein of <game:Factorio> or <game:Infinifactory>, but my experience with <game:Mindustry> wasn't as engaging as either of those games.

Mechanically it's fine: build drills to mine ore, transport it to your base with conveyor belts, place and power gun turrets to defend against nameless aliens, invest in upgrades to reach more difficult areas and build more powerful stuff... it all makes sense, and satisfies the requirement of a gameplay loop.

But the pace of making progress couldn't keep me interested.  Even in the first level, waiting for the opportunity to "launch" (finish the level) felt tedious.  Things probably spice up in later levels, but I got the distinct sense that there's a huge <b>grind</b> to go through on my way there.

And as much as I appreciate the <i>moxie</i> of a PC and <platform:Android> cross-platform release, for a game like this, touch controls just suck.  Like, really, I think it's cool that I can load this on my phone.  I just hate playing it on there.

<i>Progress: Mined a bunch of copper and lead, then got bored.</i>
