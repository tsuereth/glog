Being a cab driver (well, rideshare driver) in a cyberpunk setting sounded like a really cool narrative hook -- listening to people describe the petty human problems endemic in a <i>Blade Runner</i>-esque world.  But {{% game "Neo Cab" %}}Neo Cab{{% /game %}}'s demo lost me pretty quickly.

For one thing, the main character would <i>not shut up</i> about her best friend Savy.  Like, this girl has almost nothing more to her personality or motivation than her interest in said friend.  It makes the protagonist come across as a shallow and degrading caricature of a person.

That single-mindedness kind of leads into my other problem, which was that the "gameplay" of Neo Cab didn't really seem interested in my input.  Many games with dialog choices (like {{% game "Mass Effect" %}}Mass Effect{{% /game %}}) frustrate me because the response I <i>want</i> to pick isn't an option; but Neo Cab takes it a step further, by sometimes presenting an option that I <b>can't select</b> based on the main character's "emotional state" which I might or might not have any control over.

I don't think it's a bad thing for a game to tell a character's pre-determined story, infused with a deliberate personality -- and it's also not a bad thing to give the player options for pointing a character in a personalized direction.  But the "you can't choose that" mechanic in Neo Cab feels like the game trying to have it both ways, and that just ain't gonna work.

What I played of the demo barely hinted at intriguing subplots with an auto-pilot company named Capra, and with Savy's backstory (which some rudimentary web searching reveals is a central plot point).  But based on how much the first 20 minutes had already rubbed me the wrong way, I don't anticipate the rest of Neo Cab being any good for me.

<i>Progress: Didn't finish the demo.</i>
