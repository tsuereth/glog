<game:Depixtion> <i>looks</i> like it's just doing three nonograms to blend red, green, and blue tiles together -- but it's actually more than that.  It changes the fundamental rules of picross-style puzzles, in a way that I'm not sure I really like.

In each of the red or green or blue puzzles, there are <i>two "marked" states</i>: a light version of the color, and a dark version of the color.  (You click twice to color in darker, which isn't a great UX but whatever.)  And when light- and dark- colored sections are next to each other, there <i>isn't necessarily</i> a blank space inbetween them.

So the first new lesson to learn is that row and column hints must be counted differently.  A dark 2 followed by a light 2 doesn't mean a minimum of five cells; it means a minimum of four.  Then there are new logical scenarios to look out for, e.g. the row hints may say a cell is either light or empty, while the column hints say the cell is either dark or empty.

Normally I would be <i>excited</i> about new puzzle rules, but in Depixtion's case they seem awkwardly shoe-horned into an existing game.  I felt like I had to switch contexts and recalculate my approach in circumstances that weren't really that complicated.

It seemed like the game had to recalculate a lot, too; the way that row and column hint numbers got deactivated based on my puzzle progress didn't always track with what I'd filled in.

Maybe I'm just not "getting it," maybe I'm too set in my puzzling ways.  But in any event, I think I got all the Depixtion that I'd care to out of the demo.
