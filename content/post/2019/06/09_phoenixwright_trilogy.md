The now-archaic map navigation, the sometimes-confounding evidence solutions, the frustrating penalty/reload-savefile system, and the typos ... are no match for the intrigue, excitement, and charm of <game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy>'s later cases.

The [Trials and Tribulations](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations) cases come out swinging with backstory-establishing flashbacks, building up to a final case that ties everything together in a bombastic and incredibly satisfying conclusion.  The hours flew by as I was unable to tear myself away from reading, and clicking, through Phoenix's most thrilling case yet.

But even the Ace Attorney gang's most dire moments are punctuated by a certain light-heartedness.  Man, the localization staff sure did have fun with these games.

Though I've only just closed the final case, and already <i>miss</i> Phoenix and the Feys; replaying Wright's early years is definitely more "sweet" than "bitter."  I'm so happy that I got the chance to reacquaint myself with these long-past characters and cases.

And at the same time, I eagerly look forward to more Ace Attorney on PC.  Come on, [Apollo](game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney)!  Everything is going to be fine!

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Analogue: A Hate Story>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: ... you know what, nostalgia aside, I do look forward to the "real" puzzle gameplay in the [Apollo Justice](game:Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney), [Dual Destinies](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies), and [Spirit of Justice](game:Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice) installments.  
<b>Come on, Capcom!</b>: Just give me the chance to re-purchase more DS and 3DS games.  I'm game if you are.
