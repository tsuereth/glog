The {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" %}}Breath of the Wild{{% /game %}} sequel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00">looks exciting</a>, and the {{% game "No More Heroes III" %}}No More Heroes III{{% /game %}} reveal was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td4YZG4B_yg">a pleasant shock</a> (please, <i>please</i> don't suck).

But for me, the most surprising E3 announcement was {{% game "Spiritfarer" %}}Spiritfarer{{% /game %}}, a game where you explore the world in a boat, build a miniature town, and have a pet cat.  What I realized <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zC84nMWSQ">watching this trailer</a> is that those three things - exploring, building, cat - are like ... my top three most-wanted game features.  And I don't think they've all come together before.

(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNIHfaGRv3s">Keanu was great</a>, but, no, the fact that {{% game "Cyberpunk 2077" %}}Cyberpunk 2077{{% /game %}} is hyped-as-shit is not a surprise.  I <i>know</i> that it's going to be awesome.)
