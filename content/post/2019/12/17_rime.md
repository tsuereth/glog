<game:RiME> is a very pretty - sincerely, a very aesthetically-pleasing - experience.  Its exotic environments are visually striking, and evocative of various narratively-engaging themes of awe, curiosity, anxiety, and isolation.

But there's almost no substance to support this style.  The game doesn't control very well (there's just a <i>smidge</i> of unpredictability when jumping or running), the puzzle mechanics don't evolve after the first hour, and its most challenging moments are only thus because of <i>partially-hidden</i> climbing handholds.

RiME has no voice-overs, no expository text, no character development and <i>almost</i> no ambient storytelling.  The story it does tell, through confusingly metaphorical cinematics, takes a turn around the 4-hour point into "Oh, now I see what they're going for," but then takes <i>another</i> turn shortly afterward into <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/fb2e4ebb-5ba8-4db9-9faf-d620554fce06">"A lie is not a twist!"</a> before landing on an unfulfilling ending.

Compared to the last <tag:Tequila Works> title I played, <game:Deadlight>, RiME shows some growth in the "playability" domain.  But it's still not mechanically fun, and the story still feels meaninglessly tepid.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Deadlight>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: ... <game:Myst>?  I guess?  
<b>Roughly equivalent to</b>: <game:AER: Memories of Old>; RiME is longer, but maybe it shouldn't be.

<i>Progress: Finished, with almost no collectibles.</i>
