<game:Gato Roboto> is an adorable little <tag:Metroid> clone with a cat in a power suit.

It has doors that you shoot to open; it has elevators connecting different sections of the map; it has ability upgrades that allow you to overcome progression obstacles, including a double-jump that looks a lot like the <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Screw_Attack">screw attack</a>.

Sometimes you'll need to exit the suit and scamper through small tunnels or ventilation shafts ... kinda like <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Morph_Ball">morph-ball mode</a>.  Even the low-fidelity underground-laboratory aesthetic is highly evocative of Samus's early adventures.

So there's one problem: this game doesn't bring many new ideas to the table.  Its cute theme and occasional humor - when a human monologues at the cat, and the cat just meows back - are pretty much all that separate it from [Metroid II](game:Metroid II: Return of Samus).

My other problem with Gato Roboto is that it is, at times, <i>brutally difficult</i>.  A few enemy- and trap-filled gauntlets are frustratingly unforgiving, and one boss fight in particular is a maddening <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">bullet hell</a> with limited health and slippery movement.

Before the end, I went and got all the health upgrades and other collectibles, not because I "wanted" to 100%-complete the game; but because the upgrades felt necessary to keep up with the difficulty curve.

Gato Roboto is a perfectly competent Metroid-alike, but not much else.  I enjoyed more of my 4-5 hours with it than not, and I like the game's cute personality, but too much of it feels like a <i>tribute</i> to Samus rather than an original creation.

<b>Better than</b>: [Shantae: Risky's Revenge](game:Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut), <game:Teslagrad>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:LaserCat>  
<b>Pretty comparable to</b>: <game:Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight>

<i>Progress: 100%</i>
