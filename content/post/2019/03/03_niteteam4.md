{{% game "NITE Team 4" %}}NITE Team 4{{% /game %}} scores points on its "hacking game" contemporaries for being, as far as I've seen, the most <i>realistic</i> simulator of practical cyber offense.

It names and refers to real, relevent software packages like Apache, Exchange, and phpBB; its invented hacking utilities are (explicitly) based on real tools like Metasploit; it even refers to real-life data breaches as sources for dictionary attacks.  Sure, <i>some</i> aspects of its remote exploitation tools are a little oversimplified, but not in a way that feels like insipid technobabble.  The real-world explanations for everything help the game world feel pretty immersive and intriguing.

But... they're not quite enough to save NITE Team 4 from two critical problems of execution.

The first is the game's UI, which is more confusing to browse than it should be - where are the navigation breadcrumbs? where's the indicator of currently-running tasks? - and clutters the virtual desktop with a new terminal window for each "kind" of tool.  Like, what?  Why isn't "new window" left up to me?

And the second is the game's sometimes-ambiguous objectives.  Like the worst kinds of point-and-click adventure games, NITE Team 4 will occasionally have a goal that doesn't feel like a match for the tools you have, until you randomly decide to try {{% game "Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge" %}}using a monkey as a wrench{{% /game %}}.  Which feels less like a puzzle, and more like a trick.

I'm really happy with the realistic world-building in its premise, but at the end of the day, NITE Team 4 can be just as frustrating to play as other hacking simulators tend to.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
