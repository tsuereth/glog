After {{% game "Mario Party" %}}the first one{{% /game %}}, Mario Party never really entered into my regular gaming activities.  I'd try one installment or another, here and there, and the formula seemed pretty consistent: a turn-based version of the random and rubber-band-ey bullshit from {{% game "Mario Kart 8" %}}Mario Kart{{% /game %}}.

(Except when {{% game "Mario Party 9" %}}Mario Party 9{{% /game %}} and {{% game "Mario Party 10" %}}10{{% /game %}} did the "everyone moves in the car" thing.  That was dumb.)

{{% game "Super Mario Party" %}}Super Mario Party{{% /game %}} is no different.  There's a new "ally" mechanic which is kinda neat, adding a little strategy to dice selection; and there are some extra modes like a rhythm game, for some reason; but at its core, it's the same formula from 20 years ago.

And I wouldn't call that a bad thing, really.  The minigames are fun enough -- and more importantly, there are enough <i>of</i> them to keep the game feeling fresh over a long session.  And, as long as you don't care too much about winning, watching that aforementioned "random and rubber-band-ey bullshit" play out makes for a good time.

It may not have the same opportunity for wicked creativity as a {{% game "The Jackbox Party Pack 3" %}}Jackbox{{% /game %}}, but Super Mario Party is nevertheless a fun way to dick around with your friends.
