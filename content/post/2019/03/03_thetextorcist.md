First off: great name.  A+ there.

Second: [The Textorcist](game:The Textorcist: The Story of Ray Bibbia) has a really slick presentation, with crisp art and a pulse-pounding soundtrack.  The quality of the game's English is - ironically - a bit lacking, and the dialog scenes feel a little extravagant and unnecessary, but they look and sound good enough to put up with.

The real "meat" of the game, though, is the combat -- a bullet-hell game crossed with a typing game.  Think <game:Sine Mora> meets [Epistory](game:Epistory: Typing Chronicles), or something like [Time Crisis](game:Time Crisis 5) plus [Typing of the Dead](game:The Typing of the Dead: Overkill).  It's certainly not a genre mash-up I've seen before, and the way that it feeds back into the game's theme (reading prayers to exorcise demons!) is very thematically satisfying.

The <i>problem</i> is... it's too hard.  I just can't coordinate bullet-dodging and typing at the same time.  Maybe I'm supposed to be better at the bullet-hell part, and more strategic about the typing part?  All I know is that I get hit a lot, interrupting my typing; it feels to me like the two core mechanics work against each other too much.

Actually reminds me a lot of my time with <game:The World Ends with You>.  There's just too much going on at once for me to keep up with.

I'm really impressed by The Textorcist's design, but didn't end up having much fun playing it.
