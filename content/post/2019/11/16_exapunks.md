<game:Exapunks> has me falling in love with <tag:Zachtronics> all over again.

<game:SpaceChem> was one of my all-time favorites; and <game:Infinifactory> and <game:TIS-100> were worthy, if somewhat experimental, follow-ups.  But <game:Shenzhen I/O> was ultimately unsatisfying, and <game:Opus Magnum> was a disappointment.  In my book, Zachtronics games were declining in the quality of their puzzles, and failing in their attempts to build compelling narratives.

This resulted in me taking <i>entirely too long</i> to start Exapunks, which might now be my <b>new favorite</b> programming game.

Exapunks takes the best features of TIS-100 (like a simple but versatile instruction set) and SHENZEN I/O (varied and "cool" devices/contexts) while discarding their biggest annoyances (respectively, limited instruction space and too-simple puzzles).  Then it adds some radical new features of its own, chief among them the <tt>REPL</tt> instruction, which is just enough like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork()</a> that I could fill an entire post geeking out about it.  I won't, but I <i>could</i>.

Narratively, it <i>learns</i> from Opus Magnum's underwhelming storytelling, using a healthy variety of mechanics - ambient text, voice-overed cutscenes, and scene-setting background in the PDF manual - to weave its tale.  Its characters actually have a little mystery to them, a little intrigue, which makes me curious to discover more about them.  And the dulled-neon cyberpunk dystopia theme is definitely a winner.

Exapunks has a really fucking annoying "solitaire" minigame, just like Shenzhen I/O did.  But I won a round of it and could happily live the rest of my life without playing it again.

I don't yet know where its story will take me, but I'm looking forward to it almost as much as I'm looking forward to optimally solving new distributed-computing puzzles.
