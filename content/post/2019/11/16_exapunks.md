{{% game "EXAPUNKS" %}}EXAPUNKS{{% /game %}} has me falling in love with {{% tag "Zachtronics" %}}Zachtronics{{% /tag %}} all over again.

{{% game "SpaceChem" %}}SpaceChem{{% /game %}} was one of my all-time favorites; and {{% game "Infinifactory" %}}Infinifactory{{% /game %}} and {{% game "TIS-100" %}}TIS-100{{% /game %}} were worthy, if somewhat experimental, follow-ups.  But {{% game "Shenzhen I/O" %}}Shenzhen I/O{{% /game %}} was ultimately unsatisfying, and {{% game "Opus Magnum" %}}Opus Magnum{{% /game %}} was a disappointment.  In my book, Zachtronics games were declining in the quality of their puzzles, and failing in their attempts to build compelling narratives.

This resulted in me taking <i>entirely too long</i> to start EXAPUNKS, which might now be my <b>new favorite</b> programming game.

EXAPUNKS takes the best features of TIS-100 (like a simple but versatile instruction set) and SHENZEN I/O (varied and "cool" devices/contexts) while discarding their biggest annoyances (respectively, limited instruction space and too-simple puzzles).  Then it adds some radical new features of its own, chief among them the <tt>REPL</tt> instruction, which is just enough like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">fork()</a> that I could fill an entire post geeking out about it.  I won't, but I <i>could</i>.

Narratively, it <i>learns</i> from Opus Magnum's underwhelming storytelling, using a healthy variety of mechanics - ambient text, voice-overed cutscenes, and scene-setting background in the PDF manual - to weave its tale.  Its characters actually have a little mystery to them, a little intrigue, which makes me curious to discover more about them.  And the dulled-neon cyberpunk dystopia theme is definitely a winner.

EXAPUNKS has a really fucking annoying "solitaire" minigame, just like Shenzhen I/O did.  But I won a round of it and could happily live the rest of my life without playing it again.

I don't yet know where its story will take me, but I'm looking forward to it almost as much as I'm looking forward to optimally solving new distributed-computing puzzles.
