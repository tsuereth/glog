Based on its low price, you might guess that {{% game "Roombo: First Blood" %}}Roombo: First Blood{{% /game %}} <i>(great title, by the way)</i> is a one-note joke of a game.  And you'd be pretty much right.

I love this premise -- that you have the stealth attributes of a robot vacuum cleaner, and sneak around the house to brutally neutralize burglars, then clean up the evidence!  There's an admirable variety of traps you can "hack" (like ceiling fans and refrigerators) to damage the burglars, and by vacuuming up their blood, you build a power/rage meter for a ramming attack.

The controls aren't as smooth as I'd like - it's easy to get stuck in a corner or on furniture ... like a real robot vacuum, I guess - and the UI could use some work to indicate where multiple burglars are rummaging around.  But for the most part, the gameplay works well.

The problem is that there's only <b>one map</b>.

The game has multiple "levels" but they're all in the same house; later ones just have more burglars.  I was pretty bored by level 3.

Seriously, what a great idea for a stealth action game.  I'd be thrilled if these developers got to make more content for it: like more maps, more burglar types, more Roombo models or abilities...  As it is, I got my fill in 15 minutes.
