<platform:Netflix> is a game platform, now.  What a time to be alive.

<i>Black Mirror</i> is a fantastic and haunting series, with great production values and excellent writing -- but its most distinctive feature (like its spiritual predecessor, <i>The Twilight Zone</i>) is how it subverts the expectations of the sci-fi viewer, and challenges the assumptions - especially the optimistic, happy ones - normalized by its contemporaries.

[Bandersnatch](game:Black Mirror: Bandersnatch) does that, too, but it <i>also</i> subverts the expectations of the adventure game player.

Narratively, and here be spoilers:

>!Bandersnatch isn't just about selecting a path through the story -- the choice-making mechanic is intrinsically part of the story, itself.  The point at which Stefan starts to believe he's being "controlled" by an outside force felt like a <game:BioShock> twist moment to me; I'm absolutely tickled by how my agency was integrated <i>into</i> the story itself.!<

>!And like the best <i>Black Mirror</i> episodes, Bandersnatch revels in its misleads.  Early choices set the story up as though your choices are trivial, or meaningless; and Stefan's realization supports the idea that you, the player, are "being played" by Bandersnatch's writers.  This set-up makes the effects of later choices feel all-the-more <i>dramatic</i>.!<

>!The pair of "Netflix choice" endings felt a little overly silly, but I can't really disparage them for having some fun with themselves.!<

Mechanically, Bandersnatch has some room for improvement, but also gets some things surprisingly <i>right</i>.  Specifically, regarding how you can find and view alternate paths/endings.

Con: There's no "save file" equivalent, so once you've reached the credits, Netflix can't tell you which endings you've seen and what choices you might want to re-attempt.

Pro: In many cases, <i>before</i> the credits, Bandersnatch does give you the opportunity to return to a pivotal moment and try something else.  It uses smartly sped-up/re-cut footage to start the story over, and bring you quickly back to the moment of choice.

It ain't perfect, but Bandersnatch is wonderfully entertaining; it has real, <i>meaningful</i> interactive qualities; and it treats its [Adventure game](tag:Adventure) heritage with respect and awe.  This is an all-around treat for the game aficionado.

Also, <a href="http://www.minotaurproject.co.uk/jeff.php">Jeff Minter</a> is <b>in it</b>.  (I did a double-take when I saw his name in the credits.)

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Her Story>  
<b>I mean really</b>: If we can call dreck like <game:Shadow of Destiny> a "game," Bandersnatch has more than earned its place here.
