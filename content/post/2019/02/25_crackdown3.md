<game:Crackdown 3> isn't terrible.

Okay, maybe that's a little too reductive.  But it's really not difficult to sum up Crackdown 3 in a few words.  For instance, these words: it's a sequel to <game:Crackdown>.

No, I mean, that's really all you need to know.

Let me quote [some](%site.BaseURL%2009/04/17/crackdown-6/) of my [previously](%site.BaseURL%2009/04/28/crackdown-7/)-posted [thoughts](%site.BaseURL%2009/04/28/crackdown-8/) on Crackdown, written <b>ten years ago</b>:

* "This is a sandbox game where you can become a supercop that leaps over buildings, and tosses SUVs at gang members."
* "... there's (almost) never a dull moment."
* "... the fun of exploring the city, and the essentially-nil penalty for death (you go back to a respawn point) ..."
* "... driving sucks."
* "The game is not without flaws; sometimes the aiming gets caught on things you don't want to aim at, sometimes a target is unreasonably difficult to find and takes some wandering around to get to."
* "... once all the criminals are gone, the city really isn't as interesting anymore."

<b>All</b> of these statements are still descriptive of Crackdown 3.  Hell, even my endgame state - my driving stat is low, but the others are close to maxed - is pretty much the same as when I'd finished the first game.

That Crackdown 3 feels so faithful to its forebear is simultaneously remarkable and disappointing.  Its collectible-driven gameplay loops are <i>fun</i>, and the incredibly-bombastic combat can be a real treat.  But the game is also structurally simple, with very few twists or surprises in its missions/challenges, and a story that sounds like it was written over a weekend.

The worst part is, I doubt that someone who hadn't played Crackdown before will be able to enjoy this third iteration.  Compared to its contemporaries, Crackdown 3's controls are clunky, and its world is a bit bland.

But, for someone who enjoyed Crackdown, this is the same thing again.  With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBlhhvJ--ko">Terry Crews in it</a>.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Yooka-Laylee>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Saints Row IV>  
<b>More thrilling, but less mechanically fascinating, than</b>: <game:Agents of Mayhem>
