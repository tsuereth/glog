[The Master Trials](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - The Master Trials) DLC adds "more" content to [Breath of the Wild](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild), but <i>not good</i> content.

Its titular feature is the Trial of the Sword sidequest: a three-part series of combat-oriented challenges.  Like the main game's Eventide Island, these challenges strip you of all items and equipment -- so, on top of needing to scavenge for weapons and food, enemy attacks deal a shit-ton of damage.

And, each of the three parts is a sequence of rooms where - if you die in the middle - you'll need to restart the whole sequence.  <i>Ugh.</i>

The reward for finishing this quest is a powered-up Master Sword, ... when it wasn't already powered-up.  Meaning, while it normally deals 30 damage and is increased to 60 against Guardians, this reward will have it deal 60 damage all the time.  Which would be pretty cool except <i>it can still break</i>, so even with its "true" power, the Master Sword is no substitute for a stockpile of other good swords.

Given that, the real reward for this sidequest is the challenge of it, I guess.  With no narrative motivation, and given the high penalty for death, I lost interest in that challenge pretty quickly.

Other than the Trial of the Sword, this DLC doesn't do anything particularly praiseworthy.  There's a new teleportation rune, for setting your own fast-travel location, which is neat?

There are a few new chests scattered around the world, with throwback gear like a Majora's Mask helmet or Tingle's outfit.  Following the riddles to these chests was kinda fun, but the equipment is weak and un-upgradeable; their only function seems to be cluttering up the inventory menu.

And there's a hard mode now.  Sure, okay.

The Trials of the Sword quest, and the hard mode, might be meaningful for a player who really <i>specifically</i> enjoyed Breath of the Wild's combat, and got bored of farming Lynels.  But that seems like a pretty small niche to me.  Otherwise, I don't think anything in this DLC installment is worthwhile.

<b>Better than</b>: I don't have a good comparison, as I tend not to review story-less DLC.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: real downloadable <i>content</i>.  
<b>At least The Master Trials isn't sold separately</b>: it just comes as a "bonus" alongside [The Champions' Ballad](game:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - The Champions' Ballad).

<i>Progress: did the first part of Trial of the Sword, and collected the shiny armors.</i>
