Two years later, many parts of {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" %}}Breath of the Wild{{% /game %}} still ring familiar to me.  It's a trade-off for how awe-inspiring and memorable my first playthrough was; a replay doesn't feel quite as "special."

But that's not to say the thrill is gone, as it was when I replayed {{% game "BioShock Infinite" %}}BioShock Infinite{{% /game %}} or {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D" %}}Majora's Mask{{% /game %}}.  This iteration of Hyrule remains thoroughly <i>majestic</i>, bursting with wonder, plentiful with activity.  So much of Breath of the Wild is just satisfying to participate in.

(The "endgame" stuff I {{% abslink href="2017/03/16/the-endgame-smells-a-little-uh-...-wild/" %}}whined about before{{% /abslink %}} is still fairly unsatisfying.  But hey, I'm <i>trying</i> it this time, so it can't be all that bad ... right?)

One positive of this playthrough is that I'm appreciating the storytelling a bit more -- now that my expectations for it are low.  The supporting cast is flat (granted I haven't worked up to {{% game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - The Champions' Ballad" %}}The Champions' Ballad{{% /game %}} just yet), Link doesn't emote, Ganon is an amorphous blob, and Princess Zelda is <i>annoying</i> and kind of shitty.  But! when you realize her personal plight, the shadow of self-disappointment that she wallows in, Zelda's shittiness becomes a little easier to relate to and her character can seem borderline <i>convincing</i>.

I think Zelda's backstory probably would have worked better if, contrary to being totally non-linear, some of Link's flashbacks were up-front with that perspective on the princess.  ... but since the ending is lame anyway, lacking any sense of payoff for her, maybe it doesn't matter.

On that note, this time through the game has crystallized my thoughts on some parts of Breath of the Wild that could really be improved, and which I hope <i>are</i> improved for whatever comes next.  Like, I'm okay with the breakable weapons and the limited weapon slots, but I'm disappointed that there isn't <b>permanent</b> access (like with the Sheikah Slate) to commodity functions like torch-lighting and food-cooking.

Holding a shield is a huge defensive advantage, both passively (lowering enemy damage) and actively (blocking attacks).  Which is a dramatic disincentive against two-handed weapons.  Link's jump-dodge just isn't good enough; I think two-handers also need a block/parry button.

And there needs to be some anti-rain ability.  Rain takes away too many valuable gameplay tools - climbing, lighting a fire, <i>seeing clearly</i> - with no mitigation except to teleport away from it.  Here's hoping for some kind of magic umbrella, or maybe even a reverse <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Song_of_Storms">Song of Storms</a>.

As for the Switch game's advantages over its {{% platform "Wii U" %}}Wii U{{% /platform %}} version, without putting them side by side, it's hard for me to say if the display resolution, or level of detail, or frame rate are any better.  Far-off objects are still indistinct; long gliding sessions still show plenty of pop-in; and busy areas like Kakariko Village or the Great Deku Tree still drop frames prodigiously.

But as before, the game experience is compelling enough that these shortcomings are easy to ignore.

In short, I think that on revisiting, I'd say yeah: Breath of the Wild is still the new "best Zelda."
