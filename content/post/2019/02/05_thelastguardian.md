<game:The Last Guardian> doesn't feel like a game that took <i>ten damn years to make</i>.  At least, not in the typical sense.

Titles stuck in [development hell](game:Duke Nukem Forever) tend to come out as a scrambled mess of unrelated ideas, as a result of being left "in the oven" for so long; and often, after being rushed into a releasable state, end up unpolished and obtuse.  But that's not the case here: The Last Guardian has a fairly-direct presentation, appropriately-spartan mechanics, and a focused theme.  It's a lot like <game:Ico> and [Shadow of the Colossus](game:Shadow of the Colossus (2018)) in those ways.

<b>That's</b> the problem.  The Last Guardian is <i>too much like</i> the games that Fumito Ueda has been making for the last 20 years or so.  And without Colossus's thrilling puzzle-parkour boss fights.

It might be fascinating, to observe the development of this auteur and his craft, if The Last Guardian played like a generational improvement (or... <i>two</i> generational improvements?) over his previous work.  But it doesn't.  I could offer the compliment that its dog-bird beast has some surprisingly-lifelike animations, and that's about it.

Otherwise, it plays a lot like one of today's Unreal Engine 4 "art games," but older.  The controls haven't got much better since Colossus.  The gameplay is flat, carried almost entirely by familiar and shallow environmental puzzle-solving.  The environments look overly similar to those muddy-looking ruins we've seen so many times before.  And the storytelling is vacant, in a way that may once have been <i>mysterious</i>, but is now just <b>boring</b>.

That's my net takeaway of what I saw in The Last Guardian: nothing it's doing is interesting.  I've seen practically all of it before, and it's no longer novel or engaging.  Maybe there's something good buried later in the game?  ... but I wasn't motivated enough to stick around and find out.

What The Last Guardian showed me wasn't an advancement of Ueda-san's ideas, but a re-iteration of his old ones.  In <i>that</i> context, spending two decades making the same game over and over again, it seems a little bit more like a typical development-hell production; one that should have been abandoned quite some time ago.

<i>Progress: Saw another dog-bird, lost interest.</i>
