<game:Yoku's Island Express> is a charming, pretty, and mechanically-solid spin on the Metroidvania concept.  Actually, a more direct comparison would be <game:Toki Tori 2+>, as this is a similarly open and interconnected map of puzzles to solve.

The difference is that Yoku's Island is full of <i>pinball</i> puzzles.

It's a really neat idea.  And the seamless thematic integration of Yoku's dung-beetle rolling ball with the game map's pinball mazes feels great.

If I wasn't so terrible at pinball, I would probably love this.  Unfortunately, I just can't flip flippers with the physics precision necessary to make this mechanic fun.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
