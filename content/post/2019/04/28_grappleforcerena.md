<game:Grapple Force Rena> is an odd combination of old and new.  Its core grappling-hook mechanic is pretty cool in action, while also feeling "simple" in a way that may actually have worked in a Sega Genesis game.  Its flavor text is fun and irreverent, without dominating the flow of the game.

Sadly, that flow is also "simple" enough to be at home in a 20-year-old game.  Aside from the grappling, there isn't much gameplay going on in here; that's Rena's only attack move.  Enemies have some varied patterns, but are universally dumb and easy to out-wit.  The levels feel too maze-like, and there's no map.

Then there's the game's soundtrack, whose instruments sound suspiciously familiar to Genesis chiptunes.  And in the demo's third level, I could grapple Rena to attach to a lady with a jetpack, then fly around -- no, not just like when Tails flies with Sonic.  <i>This is a jetpack.</i>  Totally different.

Grapple Force Rena doesn't just feel overly simplistic, it feels overly attached to mechanics and constraints of a bygone era.  I guess I can appreciate the intent for nostalgia, but aping decades-old games isn't a substitute for contemporary design (like a map!).

<i>Progress: Played the first three demo levels.</i>
