Ages ago, I bounced off of the older <tag:Hitman> games due to sheer difficulty.  So it's great that <game:Hitman (2016)> has added user interface conveniences that help you stay hidden; mostly-generous autosaves to simplify recovering from a mistake; and plentiful hints (eavesdropping and otherwise) which reveal potential assassination solutions.

And I gotta say, interpreting each mission as a puzzle - sneakily impersonating wait staff to observe the target, carefully laying out the pieces of a death trap, and finally watching those pieces come together - can be pretty damn satisfying.  Particularly because of how elaborate Hitman's levels are, with so many moving parts to take advantage of.

That said, the game is pretty up-front about wanting you to replay each mission multiple times to attempt different approaches and methods.  I admire the variety of possibilities, but not quite enough to go back through a level all over again.

Also, the story is ... well, it's mysterious but not in a good way.  Bare-bones conspiracy porn stuff, like, hey there's a shadowy figure pulling strings, hey there's a secret society or something.  It's a bland excuse for gravelly voice-overs and well-animated cutscenes.

But I got more excited about Hitman's gameplay than I expected to, so that's pretty cool.  I might even have done more missions, if I hadn't run out of free/demo ones.

Now I'm at least a <i>little</i> curious about how IO Interactive's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/io-interactive-is-making-a-james-bond-game/">upcoming James Bond game</a> might turn out.
