I only played <game:Shantae and the Pirate's Curse> for a few minutes; I didn't even get far enough to judge "how Metroidvania" it is.  But I did see enough superficial, <i>non-subtle</i> similarities to [Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut](game:Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut) to tune me out pretty immediately.

Awkward hitboxes and clunky controls?  Check.  Jarring combination of high-definition UI and low-res pixel animations?  Check.

Off-beat humor that's unfortunately not strong enough to carry the game?  Check.

Shockingly obvious unpolished title screen?  ... Hey, that's a new one.

I know I'm not giving Pirate's Curse many chances, and I actually appreciate the dialog humor, but <i>come on</i> -- <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/345820/discussions/0/412446890547488688/">spelling on the title screen</a> should be a low bar to clear.
