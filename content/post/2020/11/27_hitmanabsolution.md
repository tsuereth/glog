Given my recent positive impressions of <game:Hitman (2016)>, is it possible that I missed some fun assassination-puzzle gameplay in 2012's <game:Hitman: Absolution>?

Well let me put it this way: when you re-load a checkpoint, previously-killed goons <b>respawn</b> (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/203140/discussions/0/864951657863225736/">reference 1</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/203140/discussions/0/490125737473321024/">reference 2</a>).

So, no.  If Hitman: Absolution won't allow me to retry <i>just</i> my last move - instead resetting all of my stealth clean-up, which makes me wonder if I'm supposed to shoot my way through? - then I don't think I've missed much.

<i>Progress: Gave up as soon as I was detected, and found out about this checkpoint garbage.</i>
