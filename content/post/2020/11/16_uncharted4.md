Yeah, [Uncharted 4](game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End) is a narrative tour-de-force, a showcase of gameplay innovations - even if some, like piton-climbing, were clearly cribbed from [Ms. Croft](game:Tomb Raider (2013)) - and an incredible visual treat.

The only thing it's "missing" is a varied collection of disparate set-piece events.  Not to disparage its action sequences, which do have some very high "highs," from an auction heist to a clock-tower climb and a street chase -- but few of them have that "[postcard moment](%site.BaseURL%2020/11/14/another-day-another-lost-city-to-discover-and-inadvertently-destroy/)" feeling; perhaps because so many of the game's environments look similar to one another (dank caves filled with dead pirates).

And maybe there could've been better maintenance of the childhood-flashback storyline; although as it is, the mansion burglary is a very effective narrative punctuation-mark.

But, even if it's not as good as I think it "could have" been, it's clear that A Thief's End is an excellently-entertaining game and an extremely satisfying end for Nate.

Which won't stop me from looking forward to whatever full-sized adventure comes next: whether that's a spin-off with Sam and Sully doing shady shit, a prequel with Young Nate getting into trouble, or a sequel that builds up a new generation of treasure hunters.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves>, <game:Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: I'm hoping a hypothetical follow-up might be.  
<b>In 2017 I said [Lost Legacy](game:Uncharted: The Lost Legacy) had "[one of the best [puzzles] I can remember from any Uncharted game](%site.BaseURL%2017/08/24/uncharted-generic-subtitle/)"</b>: but on revisiting A Thief's End, I really don't think anything can beat this game's pirate sigil puzzle.

<i>Progress: Finished on Explorer, again.</i>
