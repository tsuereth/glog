My recent backlog-burning has been going pretty "{{% rating "Meh" %}}Meh{{% /rating %}}", so I'd been looking forward to playing a <i>good</i> game again.  And {{% game "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves" %}}Uncharted 2{{% /game %}} delivers well-enough.

The {{% game "Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection" %}}PS4 Collection{{% /game %}}'s graphical update is still looking good five years on, and Naughty Dog's banter-filled storytelling is still top-notch, even if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative_dissonance">the dissonance</a> is hard to ignore.

On the flip side, while I've long been "over" Uncharted's combat - I switch to the Explorer difficulty by default - the <i>amount</i> of it is more groan-inducing than I'd remembered.  Drake's body count is just absurd, and pumping round after round into wave after wave of enemy goons becomes a distracting chore between story beats.

And while the climbing and parkouring controls <i>mostly</i> work well, the moments when they <i>don't</i> stand out.  Especially since the last few areas of the game seem to have so many of those moments.  Unclear map directions and misleading climbing cues may be non-critical shortcomings, but they're shortcomings just the same.

I still love how the Uncharted franchise channels the spirit of <i>Indiana Jones</i>-style globe-trotting adventure, but as the series has aged, I'm not sure if Among Thieves is as critical an entry as it once was.  I skipped over {{% game "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune" %}}the first game{{% /game %}} for this round of replays; next time, I might skip the second, too.

<i>Progress: Finished on Explorer, again.</i>
