The evil-base-defense-building genre isn't <i>exactly</i> novel, but it <i>is</i> rare, and <game:Dungeons 2> is an encouraging example of what this kind of game can offer.  If only it was less of a pain to play.

Going well beyond tower defense tactics, Dungeons 2 missions include RTS-style resource management and tech-tree growth.  Actually, those mechanics are more prominent than laying traps or creating mazes; and it's a real delight to expand the Absolute Evil's power base, literally by digging out rooms or figuratively by investing in upgrades.

The "evil" premise is also mostly-well-delivered, although I'd argue that the narrator's fourth-wall-breaking sometimes tries too hard.  At least his sense of humor is endearing, if imperfect.

But what holds Dungeons 2 back is confusing and seemingly broken controls.  Like, it's bad enough that unit management significantly changes when you switch between "underworld" and "overworld" parts of the map -- missing drag-to-select in the underworld is a real hassle when you need to move defenders against intruders.  The worst part, though, is how moving units between maps will change the camera to the destination map ... after a few seconds, stymying bulk-movement while also protracting one-by-one movement.

I'm tempted to complain about low unit limits and slow base-building, but my most recent mission suggested these might get resolved later; I finally saw a tech upgrade that'd allow more units at once, and hence more grunt workers to keep maintaining my dungeon.  But that's speculative.

Much as I admire the simultaneous underworld-management and overworld-exploration elements, Dungeons 2 makes <i>controlling</i> those elements a frustrating chore.

<b>Better than</b>: ehh, I barely played <game:Evil Genius>, which is also more than 15 years old, but... yeah?  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Overlord>  
<b>Maybe, possibly, better than</b>: <game:Brütal Legend>, but only if you ignore that game's voice cast (which is one of Brütal Legend's greatest features).

<i>Progress: Finished campaign mission 4 / met the Nagas.</i>
