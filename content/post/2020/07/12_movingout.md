The past several months of quarantine have seen my local nerd gang turn to online multiplayer (largely, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay">Steam Remote Play Together</a>) as a substitute for in-person banter.  And though we've tried a <i>ton</i> of different co-op and counter-op games, I think the one that's impressed me most is <game:Moving Out>.

At a glance, it resembles a chaotic move-fast-and-throw-things party game, like <game:Overcooked!>.  But where those games tend to rely on awkward mechanics or random events to keep things unpredictable -- Moving Out has lasting appeal due to its very <i>un</i>-awkward, <i>un</i>-random level design chops.

The game's simple controls and straightforward carry-these-objects goal clear the way for later levels to devise truly awe-inspiring arrangements of obstacles - elevators, conveyor belts, <i>flamethrowers</i>, <b><i>lava</i></b> - without feeling unfair or punishing.  (Except for the ghosts, which can fuck right off.)  Solid fundamentals and well-crafted level layouts make these absurd challenges innately achievable.

Don't get me wrong: there is still plenty of chaos to revel in, especially in initial levels which provide generous opportunities to screw around with mechanical twists like fragile boxes, or ... chickens.  But I feel like Moving Out is distinctive among party games for not using the "party" atmosphere as a crutch, instead delivering a legitimately well-built and fun furniture-carrying simulation, level after level.

The game's overall sense of humor is also an undeniable appeal, as are its many pop culture references.  I'll put it this way: the "Frogger" level isn't even my favorite.  (That honor might go to the Ferris Bueller house, which allows you to re-enact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqqVlW1a34">this memorable scene</a>.)

<i>Progress: We just got to ... outer space!</i>
