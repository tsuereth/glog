[Wuppo](game:Wuppo: Definitive Edition) isn't a "bad" game, exactly, but it's <i>weird</i> in ways that I found more off-putting than charming.

Not just because you jump with the left-bumper, or because you spend currency by equipping it like an item, or because the map is forced to share screen real estate with a pause menu.  More because the game's story is told with cartoonish nonsense - it introduces the world through a history of races with names like "Blusser" and "Splenkhakker" - and because, although the game clearly displays your objective, <i>what that objective means</i> is often elusive.

Like, my mission for most of the game thus far was to get back to the "Wumhouse" that I started in.  But how?  Well, I guess by scouring the accessible map and looking for un-followed routes, or using items with interactive elements until something new opens up.  Wuppo doesn't just obscure the path forward with a lack of bright-and-shining objective markers, but also with shades of [adventure game (il)logic](game:Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge).

And my problem with Wuppo isn't necessarily that it asks me to understand and execute on its weirdness; it's that I don't know <i>why I should</i>.  Mechanically, it's a platform-y exploration game that's pretty unremarkable outside of those weird design choices.  And narratively, the premise is that you were kicked out of a hotel for making a mess.  What, uh ... what is the point of this game?

I feel like I could "get" Wuppo if I kept trying, but it's not giving me a very good reason to do so.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Forma.8>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Headlander>  
<b>Very distinct from, but ultimately as uncompelling as</b>: <game:Strider (2014)>

<i>Progress: Got back to the hotel, then got lost and gave up.</i>
