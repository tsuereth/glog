{{% game "DYO" %}}DYO{{% /game %}} is a take on the two-player-puzzle genre that I haven't seen before: with one minotaur on the left half of the screen, and the other on the right, you can lock the viewports and <i>walk into the other half</i>.  So, for example:

* A platform is too high to jump to.  Nuts.
* But you can jump on the other character, and leapfrog up to it!
* Except now the other character is stranded below.  Until...
* You lock the screen, and the lower character can walk over to where the higher character is.

It's a neat, mind-bending trick, and the game shows off additional twists and mechanics in each level -- like staggered platforms which require adjusting the screen-locks as you climb, or a pushable block which acts as both an obstacle and a platform.

The problem is... DYO is <i>terrible</i> at teaching you how to play.  There are no hints toward how its mechanics work (the pushable block can float!?), and there's no guidance on how you should approach a puzzle.  A good puzzle-game design - really, a good design for any game - is gradually introducing new mechanics on top of old ones, so the player can learn incrementally; but every level in DYO feels totally different, a whole new set of challenges that previous levels haven't prepared you for.

The result is that figuring out each level involves a lot of staring, and a lot of trial-and-error testing if your character can make a certain-length leap or fit through a certain-size gap.  Learning the unique ins and outs of a level is tedious, and boring.

I'm impressed by DYO's cleverness (and I love the {{% game "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" %}}Sands of Time{{% /game %}}-style rewind/undo feature), but actually playing the game isn't very fun.
