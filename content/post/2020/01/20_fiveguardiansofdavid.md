<game:Five: Guardians of David> is a <tag:Diablo>-alike.  It's an action RPG from an overhead view, it's got a skill-bar and ability cooldowns, you collect equipment and money from fallen enemies -- and, like Diablo, it tells a story about the Bible.

I'll admit it: that joke was the only reason I made this post.

Guardians of David isn't a story about blood-drenched demons and angelic wrath; it's an interactive interpretation of Bible stories around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David">King David</a>.  It's actually a competent-enough game, and not what I'd call "preachy," but if you aren't already interested in the mythos of the Old Testament ... then the game's world and characters and events are pretty damned boring.

And just as in other Diablo-alikes (see: <game:Titan Quest>) this game's mechanics aren't strong enough to stand out from its forebears.
