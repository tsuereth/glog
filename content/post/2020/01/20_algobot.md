As far as programming-puzzle games go, {{% game "Algo Bot" %}}Algo Bot{{% /game %}} is over-polished tripe.

The puzzles are just too <i>easy</i>.  Algo Bot is like a gamified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>, with one path to follow; your job is to lay out a sequence of movement commands that will get the little 'bot to its destination.  That's it.

The only challenging aspect of these puzzles is fitting that sequence of commands into a program of limited length.  Occasionally, the solution will be to find a creatively optimal route, but most often - almost always - it is to "optimize" the program's use of functions.  And the term function feels like a misnomer, because they don't allow for parameterization, and there are no flow-control commands for looping or breaking; these are more like flat macros.

In other words, with a size limit of 16 commands, if you need 20 steps to get through the puzzle... you just need to move 5 of those steps into a function.  Pretty dumb, huh?

Its lack of complexity is Algo Bot's primary sin, but the obnoxious UI doesn't do the game any favors.  Command sequences are arranged by drag-and-drop - <i>ugh</i> - and by far, the most time-consuming part of the game is the program's animated execution.  Even at max speed, watching the robot float around and trigger widgets is <i>so boring</i>.

There's no redemption to be found in the game's story, either, which is a very straightforward series of excuses to move from one puzzle to the next.  The pseudo-narrator "PAL" robot has a mildly sarcastic attitude; far too mild to be entertaining.

Algo Bot is too simple, and has no interesting payoff -- playing it feels like a waste of time.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Glyphs Apprentice" %}}Glyphs Apprentice{{% /game %}}, since at least this game is tutorialized well.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Prelogate" %}}Prelogate{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Prime Mover" %}}Prime Mover{{% /game %}}  
<b>Compared to the developer's last game</b>: {{% game "Epistory" %}}Epistory{{% /game %}}, it's surprising how low Algo Bot's narrative ambitions are.

<i>Progress: Level 4-2</i>
