<game:Age of Wonders III> is a feature-rich and fairly sophisticated take on fantasy-themed 4X, but it just didn't quite "do it" for me.

Like <game:Warlock: Master of the Arcane>, Age of Wonders is largely comparable to a fantasy-themed [Civ V](game:Sid Meier's Civilization V)/[VI](game:Sid Meier's Civilization VI), but with two significant differences: story campaigns! and tactical combat!

The combat was pretty fun at first, taking direct control of units in the battlefield for optimal positioning and ability usage.  It can be a bit hard to predict the strength (or attack range) of enemy units, but this becomes clearer with more encounters and more practice.

Unfortunately, as a mission proceeds and army sizes grow, it becomes evident that this combat system <b>doesn't scale well</b>.  Not just because of lengthy battle animations (which can be sped up), but also because of the number of micro-decisions and mouse-clicks involved in controlling each unit; encounters with large numbers of units get really, really <i>dull</i>.

This problem is probably at its worst when you're sieging an enemy town: you need big numbers to overcome the enemy's defenses, and you'll spend multiple turns just <i>moving</i> each unit, one by one, a few steps closer <i>to</i> those defenses.

The minutiae of tactical combat makes it feel less like a "strategy" game and more like chess.  (I don't like chess.)  So, much as I still like the spirit of the combat system, I eventually resorted to the auto-battle option just to keep things moving along.

Even then, though... well, I'm personally a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtling_(gameplay)">turtling</a> strategy, and Age of Wonders doesn't seem super-cool with that.  It worked great at first! because there are a ton of city upgrades to invest in, for boosting production and income and <i>et cetera</i>; and the tech tree, or rather spellbook, also has a nice handful of empire-upgrading options.

But there are no infrastructural defenses that can repel invaders -- you need to have units on a city to realistically keep it.  And that, again, doesn't scale well: founding more cities leads to leaving even more units on the payroll, which makes it hard to afford standing defenders <i>everywhere</i>.  Age of Wonders seems to lean more into the "best defense is a good offense" line of thinking.

At least in the campaign missions I was playing, there are no Civ-style peaceful victory conditions: no United Nations of Wizards, no magic space rockets.  Just war.

Structurally, I'm really impressed by Age of Wonders III, and in a way it's the follow-up I've always wanted to [Heroes of Might and Magic III](game:Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia) (a childhood favorite).  I think it could be a real treat for someone who's super-into turn-based combat strategy.

But my preferred playstyle doesn't seem compatible with the campaign, and I don't find the tactical combat interesting enough to keep working at it.
