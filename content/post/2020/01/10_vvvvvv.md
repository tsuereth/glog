There is a certain amount of... I guess, <i>existential angst</i> which comes from knowing that an excellent game like {{% game "VVVVVV" %}}VVVVVV{{% /game %}} is powered by <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/2020/01/vvvvvv-is-now-open-source/">a switch statement with <tt>case 4099</tt></a>.

In his decennial musings on VVVVVV, Terry Cavanagh observes:

<blockquote>"I've gained better habits over the past decade, and I'm definitely a better programmer now -- but it does seem to take me longer to do things."</blockquote>

And having been a professional programmer over that same time period, I can relate.  In software engineering, or maybe in <i>any</i> profession, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl">drawing the rest of the owl</a> necessarily means working more steadily and more slowly; which is at odds with a common game industry objective of being first to market, damn the consequences.

And, it's not necessarily safe to assume that those consequences will be profoundly negative.  <b>VVVVVV is still fun today</b>, after ten years' worth of indie platformers competing in its wake.  VVVVVV's straightforward, almost puritanical design is as engaging and exhilirating now as it was ten years ago.

The <a href="https://souleyedigitalmusic.bandcamp.com/album/pppppp-the-vvvvvv-soundtrack">killer soundtrack</a> helps.  Ten years ago, it was in my local music library; now, I'm adding it to my streaming favorites.
