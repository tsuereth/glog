{{% game "The Deadly Tower of Monsters" %}}The Deadly Tower of Monsters{{% /game %}} isn't a parody of schlocky low-budget games, at least it's not <i>only</i> that.  It's more a parody of schlocky low-budget films, reveling in poorly-written dialog, lazy scene-setting, and low-quality special effects.

As such, it might not be as painfully <i>anti-fun</i> as {{% game "Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard" %}}Matt Hazard{{% /game %}}'s intentionally-bad gameplay, but Deadly Tower still represents an epic self-petard-hoisting.  It's a send-up of shitty content, and all of its content... is shitty.

This isn't to say that the game's problems are <i>limited</i> to flat characters and trope-y enemy designs.  Button-mashy combat is dull even when it works, and it frequently <i>doesn't</i> work due to loose-feeling input and janky-ass camera movement.  But mechanical shortcomings like those could have been "part of the joke" if the game's sense of humor was a strong-enough enticement to keep moving forward.

Unfortunately in-game events aren't {{% game "Saints Row: The Third" %}}absurd enough{{% /game %}}, or {{% game "Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon" %}}winking-at-the-camera enough{{% /game %}}, to be genuinely funny.  They're just bad.

It's a shame, because in theory the game's "DVD commentary" narration is a great gimmick: an elegant way for a voice-over to explain your current objectives while simultaneously providing colorful jabs and musings.  In practice, though, those jabs are woefully uninspired (like a remark about animal actors flinging their feces) and the musings are too few and far between.

<i>Progress: Got "to" the tower, I think?</i>
