I recently plugged in a new graphics card (no, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-rtx-3080-stock-check-october/">not this one</a>) and needed some way to try out a few extra GBs of VRAM.  A little ironic that the 2015 version of a 2013 game was the best I could do to exercise some 2019 hardware; but what started as a simple benchmark led me to a more-or-less full replay of <game:Grand Theft Auto V>.

Unlike my recent re-attempt at [GTA IV](game:Grand Theft Auto IV) - and more like [The Ballad of Gay Tony](game:Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony) - GTA V remains engaging, enjoyable, and <i>not inconvenient</i>.  Only one or two missions felt like tedious bullshit, and this game's tow-truck and stevedore diversions were much less aggravating than IV's bowling or <game:Red Dead Redemption>'s cattle-herding nonsense.

While a few awkward story moments (like Trevor and Michael's abrupt reunion) and ultimately unsatisfying character arcs keep GTA V from narrative greatness, its storytelling is still "good," and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O31_2k1Dzq8#t=3m24s">snide silliness</a> is still genuinely entertaining.

And while Los Santos isn't as dense with activities as some more modern sandbox games - nor are its side-objectives as easy to find - there's still no shortage of <i>stuff</i> to do, and the driving gameplay (and occasional random or emergent action) between points A and B is just <b>fun</b>.

I don't know if it'll last another five years; as with my old favorites [Red Faction: Guerrilla](game:Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered) and <game:The Saboteur>, I expect the industry will eventually make this game feel pretty obsolete.  But for now, it's still one of the best open worlds we've got.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt>  
<b>Ehh, let's say, on-balance equitable to</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Knight>

<i>Progress: Picked option "C," did most of the map-icon missions.</i>
