The two facts I could remember about <game:Batman: Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge> were that it was (1) good, and (2) short.

Like, I didn't distinctly remember that <i>Robin is in it</i>.  That's how un-memorable this DLC is overall.

It <i>is</i> still good, though.  Harley Quinn's (brief) Revenge tells a fun little story that includes some combat, some stealth, and even a puzzle or two.  It doesn't bring much new to the table - other than Robin's shield, which ... doesn't work very well - but it's also short enough to not wear out its welcome.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Fallout 4: Vault-Tec Workshop>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart>  
<b>Pretty underwhelming use of a new playable character</b>: but it does serve as good prototyping for the larger cast in [Arkham Knight](game:Batman: Arkham Knight).
