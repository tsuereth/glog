I recently watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0859163/">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a> (December, 2008) and was shocked at some of the visual similarities to [Uncharted 2](game:Uncharted 2: Among Thieves) (October, 2009).

For the record, <i>Mummy: Jet Li</i> was <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mummy_tomb_of_the_dragon_emperor">pretty awful</a>.

<b>Exhibit A</b>: The Mummy crew and Team Drake both visit an ancient Himalayan village.

<b>Exhibit B</b>: Yetis, who crash both of the aforementioned parties.

<b>Exhibit C</b>: Both the Dragon Emperor and Lazarevic seek eternal life in Shangri-La (which Nathan Drake calls "Shambhala").

Although its commercial failure suggests that not many people actually saw <i>The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</i>, I'm <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/955125-uncharted-2-among-thieves/57530897">not the only one</a> to note some resemblance between these two productions.  Did Naughty Dog draw inspiration from Mummy 3 for some of its late-game environment art?

... or did both productions use some common reference material?  Yeah, that seems more likely, especially since by 2008 much of Uncharted 2's art should already have been done.  In fact, some <a href="https://psychphan.wordpress.com/tag/uncharted-2-among-thieves/">internet sleuthing</a> shows that some of these common elements may have prior art from <i>1997</i>, in <game:Tomb Raider II>.

So I guess the moral here is that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/131591-nothing-is-original-steal-from-anywhere-that-resonates-with-inspiration">nothing is original</a> (including the very realization that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nothing-we-do-is-original-anymore-so-find-things-worth-imitating-2012-8">nothing is original</a>).
