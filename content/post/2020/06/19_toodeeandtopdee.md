<game:Toodee and Topdee> starts with a really fascinating premise: mashing up side-scrolling and top-down paradigms.  Switch between a Mario-style character who can jump between platforms, and a Link-style character who can <i>move those platforms</i>.  Toodee's initial levels feel like a call-out to games like <game:Fez> or <game:Super Paper Mario> -- "perspective changes are <i>old news</i>."

Unfortunately, the puzzle mechanics built on top of that premise are mostly underwhelming.  The first time I jumped in sidescroller mode, then switched to top-down and placed a box under myself, was cool; but doing this move three or more times in a row just to cross a gap is kinda lame.  As is switching back and forth to control gravity with precise timing (aligning falling sidescroller blocks with top-down pits).  And there are some counter-intuitive assumptions in mechanics like keys, which apparently still count even if an enemy picks them up.

The controls also don't work as well as they should for a platform-puzzler.  Like, sometimes horizontal movement stops working mid-jump.  I think the game engine loses some inputs when multiple buttons are held down? -- whatever the reason, it's a bad problem to have.

As for story, I like that the game <i>has</i> one, but it's a little groan-inducing.  Toodee's opening establishes a motif of its divine creator as a programmer, creating varied worlds, tasking an entity named <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125320/do-todo-comments-make-sense/125322">Toodoo</a> with tracking glitches, and making these worlds revolve around ... a semicolon.  Like, a literal, giant floating semicolon is what separates worlds and keeps glitches in-check.  I "get" the joke but it's pretty lame.

But I digress.  What made me stop playing the demo wasn't its story, but its uncreative and sometimes incongruous mechanics.  I'm not completely writing off Toodee yet, but it'll need quite a bit more puzzle-design polish before I'm interested in playing it again.

<i>Progress: Finished a few levels in the demo.</i>
