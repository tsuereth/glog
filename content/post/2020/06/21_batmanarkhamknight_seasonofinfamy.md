Unlike previous Bat-DLCs, <i>(deep breath)</i> <game:Batman: Arkham Knight - Season of Infamy: Most Wanted Expansion> doesn't just throw you into a series of arenas and ignore everything you've done in the main game.  Instead, it <b>adds optional missions to [Arkham Knight](game:Batman: Arkham Knight)'s campaign</b>.

What a thought, right?  Actually "expanding" the existing game?  Brilliant.

Although there are clear signs that this content was an afterthought - there's literally a separate room in the GCPD building for these villains' cells and evidence lockers - these new missions nevertheless feel like cozy companions to the game's original Most Wanted.  And they employ a rich variety of Arkham Knight's mechanics, including exploration and investigation, which is a refreshing change of pace from <i>just fighting shit</i>.

Do I wish that there were more than four new missions?  Yup.  Do I wish that the Mad Hatter's obligatory hallucination sequence was longer and more fanciful?  Yup.  Do I wish that Mr. Freeze and Ra's al Ghul had more presence in their missions?  ... A little.

But I'm happy with the gameplay and narrative quality of these diversions, I'm happy with how well they integrate into Arkham Knight's story, and hell, I'm even happy to see Killer Croc again.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart> and all the other Arkham DLCs.  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone>  
<b>The "right" way to play this</b>: is probably by having it from the <i>beginning</i> of Arkham Knight.
