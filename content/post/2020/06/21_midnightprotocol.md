<game:Midnight Protocol> appears to sit somewhere between <game:Hacknet> and <game:NITE Team 4>, in terms of both realism and aesthetics.  Its hacking mechanisms are less artificial than Hacknet's, though still abstracted from reality to be more "game-y."  And while it revolves around a flashy node-based network visualization (similar to hacking in the newer <tag:Deus Ex>es), you still control everything with a command-line interface.

Unlike most hacking games, Midnight Protocol is turn-based: the "trace" countdown only ticks when you take an action.  So, you can take your time planning how to optimize the CPU usage of exploit and stealth programs.  There's an <game:Uplink>-style economy, where your ill-gotten money can be used to purchase upgrades -- the demo didn't show it, but there <i>is</i> a "hardware" tab, so I assume that your rig will scale up (as will program requirements) over time.

And the story teased by the demo is promising: you've got a dark past, there's some underground conspiracy, a hack gets abruptly interrupted by a counter-hack with ominous messaging... all typical stuff, but the quality of the writing "sells" it fairly well, typos notwithstanding.

Basically, everything I saw in this demo was <b>good</b>.  But I'm trying not to get my hopes up; hacking games have a habit of letting me down with some combination of clunky interfaces, under-baked game design, and boring narratives.  I'll want to see some post-release opinions on whether the rest of Midnight Protocol can measure up to my admittedly-high standards.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
