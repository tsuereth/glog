My understanding of the {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Arkham Knight{{% /game %}} DLC situation had been that, while most of its "story" packs were in the same neighborhood as the {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight - Harley Quinn Story Pack" %}}Harley Quinn pre-order bonus{{% /game %}} - which I previously described as a {{% abslink href="2015/06/30/almost-the-game-gotham-deserves/" %}}"pretty baffling disappointment"{{% /abslink %}} - the Batgirl-centered {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight - A Matter of Family" %}}A Matter of Family{{% /game %}} was much more substantial and worthwhile.

That turns out to be a half-truth.  The "more" part is true; not the "much" part.

A Matter of Family is set some time prior to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke">The Killing Joke</a></i>, and starts with a flimsy excuse to set Batgirl and Robin up against the Joker <i>sans</i> Batman.  (Joker claims that he'll kill Jim Gordon if Batman shows up.  Since when would that stop the Bat?)  The map is open, but miniature -- Seagate Amusement Park is an artificial island isolated from the rest of Gotham, and its size feels comparable to <i>one section</i> of {{% game "Batman: Arkham Asylum" %}}Arkham Asylum{{% /game %}}'s overworld.

After the DLC's intro, you're tasked with rescuing three groups of hostages.  While the map's openness means that you can go after these groups in any order -- after the first and second rescues, there is a non-optional objective to defuse a bomb at a specific location; then after the third rescue, a boss fight.  So aside from picking which hostage to rescue first, the mission is intensely linear.  And the whole affair is like, <b>one or two hours long</b>, maybe another if you seek out the optional collectibles (which I didn't).

Batgirl's moves and gadgets are all the same as Batman's, but fewer.  The only "new" ability here is that some hackable objectives and traps don't require a password, that is, using the hacking gadget just finishes the hack automatically.  Yes, that is a vanishingly minor distinction from Batman's kit.

A Matter of Family "works" in the sense that it delivers some of the same great stealth and combat fundamentals as Arkham Knight.  Otherwise, this DLC pack is shallow, un-innovative, and utterly uncompelling.  It's got more meat to it than the <i>other</i> story packs, but ... that's a pretty low bar to clear.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight - Harley Quinn Story Pack" %}}Batman: Arkham Knight - Harley Quinn Story Pack{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Batman: Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge" %}}Batman: Arkham City - Harley Quinn's Revenge{{% /game %}}  
<b>I kinda can't believe</b>: that {{% game "Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart" %}}Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart{{% /game %}} ended up being the best standalone Batman episode.
