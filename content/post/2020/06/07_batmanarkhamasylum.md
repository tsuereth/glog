<game:Batman: Arkham Asylum> is still good enough to start on a Sunday afternoon and finish later that same evening.

Like I [wrote last time]($SiteBaseURL$2016/02/28/die-hard-batman-edition/), there are some mechanical shortcomings - compared to later Arkham games - which are plainly evident.  Some combat gadgets don't exist yet, the tactics for Titan enemies are pretty limited, and you can't stealth-takedown from a floor grate (!!).  As a result, revisiting Arkham Asylum does have a bit of an "old" feeling to it -- not a big deal, though I wonder if I'll still be this forgiving in another five-or-ten years.

On the other hand, Arkham Asylum demonstrates some prowess which present-day games still struggle to measure up to.  Its story pacing is <i>great</i> - maintaining a steady rhythm of supervillain cameos and plot reveals from beginning to end - and it's incredible to see how those story events affect the world map.  Actually, it's hard for me to think of a better example of this particular Metroidvania tenet: when a game uses backtracking as an opportunity to demonstrate how the narrative is changing the game world.  (<game:Metroid Fusion> did pretty well at this, from what I recall.)

And while I'm not going out of my way to finish this game's collectibles, that's only because I've <i>done it before</i>.  They're way more attainable than the absurd amount of Riddler bullshit in following games, and this set of character profiles represents a surprising volume of Batman memorabilia.

Arkham Asylum may not have the openness of its followers, but its tight craftsmanship makes it a tough act to follow.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone>  
<b>We'll find out soon</b>: whether [Arkham City](game:Batman: Arkham City) has aged so well.
