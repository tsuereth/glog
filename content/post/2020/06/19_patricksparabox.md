My initial concern in <game:Patrick's Parabox> was that the mechanical distinction between "push this block" and "enter the maze inside this block" is too ambiguous.  I.e., you can't enter the side of a block until its opposite side is against a wall, and pushing an un-pushable block may have unexpected consequences if you're not paying attention.  As more blocks and more pushing come into play, this gotcha could become frustrating.

But the demo levels didn't grow horizontal complexity like I expected -- they grew <i>depth</i> complexity.  The last level I played had, like, four nested layers of block to traverse through.  <i>Now</i> my concern is forgetting which layer I'm currently in.

That's just the kind of mind-twisting puzzle mechanic that I'm interested in learning more about.  (And Parabox is more immediately accessible and rewarding than my peeks into <game:Recursed> have been, so far.)

I'm not "sold" on this one yet, but certainly ... intrigued.  I wonder how the full game's later puzzles will turn out.

<i>Progress: 14 puzzles solved in the demo.</i>
