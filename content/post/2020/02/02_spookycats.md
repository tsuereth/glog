I try not to throw around the "<rating:Awful>" rating lightly; hell, I got through 2019 without using it at all.  There are few games that I [outright hate enough]($SiteBaseURL$2020/02/01/infuriating/) to earn the label, and I tend to avoid games with obviously-shoddy production values.  But sometimes such a game sneaks into a bundle ... like <game:Spooky Cats> did.

Minimal, repetitive art and audio?  Check.  A bare-bones main menu that was clearly an afterthought?  Check.  Poor sense of aesthetic design that makes levels visually confusing?  <i>Checkarooney.</i>

Spooky Cats demonstrates the creator's ability to program a modicum of game logic.  It isn't something that anyone should be expected to exchange money for.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Miner Ultra Adventures>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Cubots: The Origins>  
<b>The collectibles are pennies?</b>: Why not cat toys, or cat food, or ... something that has <i>anything</i> to do with cats?

<i>Progress: Finished a few levels, who cares how many.</i>
