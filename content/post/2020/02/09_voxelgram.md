I went into the <game:Voxelgram> demo expecting it to be exactly like <game:Picross 3D>, and it <i>is</i> extremely similar.  But, thanks to PCs generally having larger displays than a Nintendo DS, Voxelgram is able to pull off some much larger puzzles.  Just in its first 10 or 20 puzzles, I think they've already exceeded Picross 3D's peak size and complexity.

The controls have a bit of a learning curve: at first, I was really frustrated trying to find hints by rotating the puzzle around.  But the game made a lot more sense once I caught on to the layer-walking mechanics, and solving each layer as a 2D portion of the larger puzzle.  The camera rotation still isn't perfect, like sometimes my clicks hit an empty puzzle space when I wanted to grab <i>outside</i> the puzzle, but the "undo" button resolves such problems easily enough.

Anyway, despite initially thinking that Voxelgram was a shitty version of a game I played ten years ago, I'm now looking forward to chipping away at huge blocks and solving even more puzzles in the full version of the game.

(This game also doesn't have any bullshit time limits, so it's got that going for it.)

<i>Progress: Played enough of the demo to know that I'm hooked.</i>
