<game:The Pedestrian> has a very cool aesthetic: its 3D backdrops make the simple platforming levels seem a lot more interesting than they actually are.

But, yeah.  The platforming is pretty remedial.  Controls feel a bit slippery, too; considering the 2D platform levels are all about sharp lines, it's surprising how squishy the hit detection is.

Toward the end of the demo, the game's "puzzle" aspects <i>started</i> to heat up -- figuring out how to properly connect rooms such that you can hit switches, reach platforms, and pick up keys in the necessary sequence.

More of those puzzles could be cool, but I dunno if it's worth sleepwalking through the dull platforming segments inbetween them.

<i>Progress: Finished the demo.</i>
