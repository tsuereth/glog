{{% game "Borderlands 3" %}}Borderlands 3{{% /game %}} is a <i>technological</i> step forward, and it succeeds in <i>reiterating</i> the franchise's manic-weapons-and-zany-scenarios formula.  But it barely attempts to meaningfully distinguish itself from its predecessors, and those attempts don't generally work in the threequel's favor.

I want to be clear that the core "Borderlands" gameplay - running around and shooting bandits and exploding their dumb faces - is surviving and thriving in Borderlands 3.  Its character classes are powerfully distinctive.  Its combat is more beautifully chaotic than ever, with what feels like a record number of enemies in every encounter.  Its new environments and their corresponding enemy designs are diverse and creative, as are the random weapon drops; upgrading from one crazy weapon to another, differently-crazy one is still a blast.

But given that we're nearly a decade on from {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}} (and 5+ years from the {{% game "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" %}}Pre-Sequel{{% /game %}} side-story), it seems reasonable to expect Borderlands 3 to stand out from its forebears.  It doesn't -- instead, it's more like a remaster of the second game, with an upgraded engine and re-skinned content.  Everything it does well was <i>also</i> done well in Borderlands 2.

That "remaster" sensation includes some surprising failures to meet contemporary game expectations.  You can't track multiple quests at a time, finding fast-travel destinations is a pain, even <i>clicking on menu buttons with a mouse</i> just doesn't work as well as it should.  (Which is especially confounding since the game has been released on PC for over a year, now.)

And, while there are a few stand-out moments in Borderlands 3's narrative - here I'm thinking particularly of <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/BALEX">Ice-T</a>'s and <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Pain_and_Terror">Penn and Teller</a>'s amazing guest spots - it overall falls short of the bar set by Handsome Jack's tale.  Troy and Tyreen are lackluster villains (more annoying than anything else), cutscenes distractingly <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">railroad the story away from you</a>, late-game plot revelations fall flat, and even cameos from series favorites like Tiny Tina (who's less tiny, now) are disappointingly short-lived.

Also, what the hell happened to the "effervescent" items showed off in {{% game "Borderlands 2: Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary" %}}Borderlands 2: Commander Lilith and the Fight for Sanctuary{{% /game %}}?  I thought that teasing those super-shiny guns for the third game was, like, the whole point of that DLC.

... but I digress.

The problem isn't that Borderlands 3 is un-fun -- it <i>is</i> fun.  In terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, it's as fun as the series has ever been.  It just seems like it's still lingering in the shadow of Borderlands 2.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" %}}Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Borderlands 2" %}}Borderlands 2{{% /game %}}  
<b>Waiting for its DLC packs</b>: to be <i>done</i>, let alone be on sale at a reasonable price.

<i>Progress: Beat the main campaign.</i>
