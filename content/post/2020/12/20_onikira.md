I know that I've impulse-purchased [some](game:Super Daryl Deluxe) [questionable](game:Mugsters) [games](game:Cubots: The Origins), but this year - as I've made a concerted effort to clean up my backlog - it's struck me just <i>how many</i> poor purchasing decisions are in there.

Enter <game:Onikira: Demon Killer>.  Why did I buy this?  Maybe because its screenshots look shiny and colorful, like <game:Muramasa: The Demon Blade>?  Evidently I didn't pay enough attention to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/310850/">Steam reviews</a>, or I would have considered that Onikira might have quality control issues.

<i>The context in the previous screen doesn't turn that subtitle into a question.  That's just a typo.</i>

Only a few minutes with Onikira was enough to convince me to uninstall.  It's a sloppy implementation of a game I've played and gotten tired of many times before.  ([Shaq Fu](game:Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn) being a recent and poignant example.)

It's somewhat fulfilling to clear the trash <i>out</i> of my backlog, but as I'll describe in my upcoming year-end review, games like this are why I frequently return to known quantities like [Batman](tag:Batman: Arkham) and [GTA](tag:Grand Theft Auto).

<i>Progress: Didn't even make it through the tutorial.</i>
