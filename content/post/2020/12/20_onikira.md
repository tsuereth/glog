I know that I've impulse-purchased {{% game "Super Daryl Deluxe" %}}some{{% /game %}} {{% game "Mugsters" %}}questionable{{% /game %}} {{% game "Cubots: The Origins" %}}games{{% /game %}}, but this year - as I've made a concerted effort to clean up my backlog - it's struck me just <i>how many</i> poor purchasing decisions are in there.

Enter {{% game "Onikira: Demon Killer" %}}Onikira: Demon Killer{{% /game %}}.  Why did I buy this?  Maybe because its screenshots look shiny and colorful, like {{% game "Muramasa: The Demon Blade" %}}Muramasa: The Demon Blade{{% /game %}}?  Evidently I didn't pay enough attention to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/310850/">Steam reviews</a>, or I would have considered that Onikira might have quality control issues.

<i>The context in the previous screen doesn't turn that subtitle into a question.  That's just a typo.</i>

Only a few minutes with Onikira was enough to convince me to uninstall.  It's a sloppy implementation of a game I've played and gotten tired of many times before.  ({{% game "Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn" %}}Shaq Fu{{% /game %}} being a recent and poignant example.)

It's somewhat fulfilling to clear the trash <i>out</i> of my backlog, but as I'll describe in my upcoming year-end review, games like this are why I frequently return to known quantities like {{% tag "Batman: Arkham" %}}Batman{{% /tag %}} and {{% tag "Grand Theft Auto" %}}GTA{{% /tag %}}.

<i>Progress: Didn't even make it through the tutorial.</i>
