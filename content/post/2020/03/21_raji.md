The demo of <game:Raji: An Ancient Epic> shows off some sloppy story cutscenes, mediocre level design (far too easy to get lost), frustrating combat design (groups of enemies stunlock you to death), and a few abilities that just don't seem to control correctly.

So why am I interested in it?  Because it's been <i>ten years</i> since <game:Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands>, and even <i>that</i> felt like a shadow of the 3D PoP games.

I wouldn't say that Raji "nails" the pillar-climbing, wall-running, and monster-slashing spirit of the 2000s-era [Prince of Persias](tag:Prince of Persia), ... but it could be close enough.  Here's hoping they polish this game up some more before release.
