I normally shy away from demos for unfinished games - <game:CrossCode> left me hanging for <i>years</i> - but who would say no to an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamgamefestival-spring">online-only festival</a>?  Or to a Metroidvania-styled sidescroller, at that?

And after a few minutes with [Batbarian](game:Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials), I felt like this could be the game I <i>wanted</i> <game:Chasm> to be.  Hand-crafted levels with precise platforms and traps, instead of procedurally-generated, boring filler; tight controls that don't make every enemy a struggle; and, while Batbarian's demo didn't show much of a story, it <i>does</i> show personality through humorous dialog.

And, you know, the usual -- experience points and level-ups, key items that enhance your abilities, hidden secrets behind breakable walls.  For a pre-release demo, it already shows quite a lot of polish in how its secrets blend into the environment.

I'm still interested in what reviews will be like post-release, but Batbarian certainly has my attention.
