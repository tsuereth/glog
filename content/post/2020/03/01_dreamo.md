{{% game "The Witness (2016)" %}}The Witness{{% /game %}} did a really fantastic job of building a {{% game "Myst" %}}myst{{% /game %}}erious world around its seemingly-incongruous puzzles.  {{% game "Dreamo" %}}Dreamo{{% /game %}} appears to have the same goal -- unfortunately its demo doesn't show much of that world; instead, it focuses on the puzzle mechanics.

And while you could argue that The Witness's puzzles were sometimes simple - at least to start - they were very rarely "stupid" in the sense of being fiddly or frustrating.  Dreamo's demo, on the other hand, took only a few minutes to show me a really ambiguous and aggravating mechanic that quickly turned me off.

Some gear shafts will toggle-up and -down based on clicking other gear shafts, almost like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)">Lights Out</a> game.  And if you have gears attached to such shafts while toggling them, even on another plane of the cube, those gears will pop off and effectively reset your progress.  Not necessarily because they were placed wrong, but because some <i>unrelated</i> shafts weren't in the right position.

I'm kinda curious about Dreamo's world, but based on the puzzling I saw in the demo, ... nah.

<i>Progress: Didn't finish the demo.</i>
