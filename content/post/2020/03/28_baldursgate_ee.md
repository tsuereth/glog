I waited too long to try [Baldur's Gate](game:Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition).

Even in its slightly-more-current Enhanced Edition, this definitely feels like a 20-year-old game.  The character creator is onerous, the tutorials are clunky, the UI is a tad byzantine, and the world just ... <i>doesn't seem interesting</i>.  I'd have been willing to tolerate the former problems, but the game's opening minutes weren't compelling enough -- all mechanical dialogs and banal fetch-quests.

I get that the setting and characters might become more engaging later on, but I'm not interested in spending hours slaying rats and twiddling with character pages just to get there.  My expectations for immersive-world RPGs have been spoiled by more modern games like [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) and [Skyrim](game:The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition).

<i>Progress: Didn't make it out of the starting town.</i>
