<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JxfuAl4KLM">Review 1</a> (paraphrased): <game:Ori and the Will of the Wisps> is <i>heavily inspired</i> by ideas and mechanics from <game:Hollow Knight>.  It has customizable "shard" (pin) slots, it has an upgradeable sword, it has informative NPCs, it has tactical combat against diverse enemies and bosses, it even has an undergound environment infested with bugs.

And... that's cool, I guess.  But it doesn't resolve my frustrations with [the original game](game:Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition)'s punishing save system.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgxLf3GY8RY">Review 2</a>: "One element that factored into the original's difficulty, that's no longer present, was the option to manually generate your own save points.  Instead, the sequel automatically does this for you.  This is a much better solution that allows you to focus on the best parts of the game, rather than worrying about a bothersome mechanic that could potentially result in losing progress."

... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm705Itp2OU">you don't say?</a>

This sequel evidently still has the kind of chase sequences I previously described as "bullshit," and maybe even more of the platforming mechanics I decried years ago.  But the save-points change is a good one.
