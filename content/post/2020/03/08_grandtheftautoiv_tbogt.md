Niko's story starts cinematically and moves very slowly; Luis's doesn't hesitate to throw you into firefights (or off of a building).  Niko has difficulty accessing high-powered cars and guns; Luis has no problem picking up a supercar, or explosive shotgun shells.  Niko's missions {{% abslink href="2020/03/04/hey-cousin-lets-restart-the-mission/" %}}pissed me off{{% /abslink %}} with their infrequent and unforgiving checkpoints; Luis's missions have plenty of checkpoints and are a trivial inconvenience to retry.

(I still hate the shit out of losing my weapons when I'm arrested, but, whatevs.  Being able to call up a Gun Van helps, too.)

{{% game "Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony" %}}The Ballad of Gay Tony{{% /game %}} is a bit on the short side, and it doesn't have the <i>gravitas</i> of Niko's personal tale of redemption and vengeance.  But it still has some of the best action, storytelling, and sandbox mechanics of the {{% tag "Grand Theft Auto" %}}GTA{{% /tag %}} franchise, or really of any game.

I'm sure that graphical expecations will leave it behind eventually... but for its breakneck pacing and generous checkpointing, TBOGT holds up really well, ten years later.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Grand Theft Auto IV" %}}Grand Theft Auto IV{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: eh... {{% game "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" %}}The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt{{% /game %}}?  
<b>It'd be a real shame</b>: if the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gta-4-returns-to-steam-on-march-19-without-multiplayer/">upcoming re-launch</a> loses the rights to Vladivostok FM's club music.

<i>Progress: Finished the main missions, none of the side missions.</i>
