I've put significantly more time - 75 hours - into <game:Pictopix> than any other nonogram game.  So, yeah, it's pretty good.

The game's "Classic" mode includes 195 puzzles, plus several hidden bonus puzzles; three huge puzzle mosaics; an endless generated-puzzle mode; and Steam Workshop user-made puzzles.  In terms of quantity, Pictopix rivals the absurd puzzle count of <game:Pepper's Puzzles>, and without leaning on arguable copyright infringement.

Then there's size: 45 of Pictopix's puzzles have sides of 30 or more cells -- 15 of them have sides of <i>40 cells</i>.  Its handful of 40x40 puzzles are bigger than <game:Paint it Back>'s biggest, although not as big as <game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter> could get.

In other words, Pictopix has a ton of puzzles and some of them are really big.  The amount and complexity of puzzle content is definitely a "win."

The feature-set is ... fine.  You can Suspend a puzzle to save progress and come back later; puzzles must be unlocked gradually, but the number of unlocks is generous; it penalizes mistakes, but allows a comfortable number of them for free.  One quality-of-life bit I really liked is that the game automatically pauses if it loses focus -- like if you alt-tab out, or if an annoying OS pop-up interrupts your game.

The zoom function is limited and kinda glitchy - all it does is abbreviate the hint displays, and the way those hints slide back into view is wonky and confusing - but fortunately, the interface is concise enough that I rarely needed to zoom in.

Pictopix also has segment-based hints, i.e. graying out hint numbers as you make progress in a row or column, <i>but</i> having that feature turned on prevents you from getting some achievements.  So, I can't say how well it really worked, because I didn't use it.

Really the only complaint I have about Pictopix is that I had to re-attempt some of its biggest puzzles due to mistakes I'd made that <i>would have</i> been prevented by those automatic segment hints.  But since turning that off was my own (achievement-addiction) choice, it's hard to blame the game for that.

While Pictopix isn't quite as feature-rich as Nonogram - The Greatest Painter, it also doesn't embarrass itself by crashing all the time.  And otherwise its puzzle quantity and quality are competitive with the best I've seen.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Nonogram - The Greatest Painter>, <game:Paint it Back>, <game:Pepper's Puzzles>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: ... well, I guess that makes it the best nonogram game I've played so far.  
<b>Though I do wish it had some personality, or theme</b>: like <game:My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess>

<i>Progress: Finished all non-workshop puzzles, got all achievements.  Phew!</i>
