<game:Windward> is one of those long-since-backlogged titles where I can't even remember when I got it.  I can imagine <i>why</i>, though: sailing the open seas, completing sidequests, and trading up for bigger and more powerful <b>pirate ships</b> should scratch the same itches as <game:Rebel Galaxy> or <game:Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag> did.  What could go wrong?

Unfortunately, it seems I neglected to notice the "Procedural Generation" tag on this game -- and thus the implication that it has no cohesive plot or narrative.  There are quests, and there are even "factions," but... there <i>isn't</i> an over-arching motive for <i>why</i> I should hoard enough money to buy more cannon portholes.  Who am I and what am I doing here?  ... just ferrying things from place to place, I guess?

Without a compelling introductory hook, and with no written characters (let alone character development), Windward feels less like a swashbuckling simulator and more like a port-trading simulator.  Personally, I can't get engaged in such a world; if I don't have compatriots to impress, or villains to crush, the power fantasy is just too shallow.

<i>Progress: Almost none.</i>
