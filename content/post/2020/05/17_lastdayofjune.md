Making a "walking simulator" is an inherently risky proposition.  I mean, sure, you can save a lot of development time by forcing the player down a specific path and not having to design or implement <i>gameplay</i> -- but those savings can come back to bite you if the game's remaining components, its story and presentation, aren't strong enough on their own.

So it is with <game:Last Day of June>, which not only has a total lack of narration and an underwhelming art style - its characters' child-like proportions, and <i>empty eye sockets</i>, are more haunting than charming - but lazily trots out an overused "tragic car accident" plot.  (Like <game:Dear Esther>, but in third-person!)

At least, that's what it seemed like in the first 20 minutes.  The game moves so slowly and is so melancholically <i>boring</i> that I just didn't care to continue with it.
