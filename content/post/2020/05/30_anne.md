<game:A.N.N.E.> is one of <i>only two!</i> remaining crowdfunded/early-access games that I've bought but am still waiting for.  <i>(Ref.: [Early Access, Late Release](%site.BaseURL%2018/01/21/early-access-late-release/))</i>

And <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/262370/announcements/detail/2117196326623902205">as of last month</a>, the developer's plan was to hit feature-complete on May 20th.  So it should come as no surprise that on May 20th the release plan was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/262370/announcements/detail/1696100248032793314">updated to "maybe never"</a> (paraphrasing).

Considering the initial release estimate was in 2014, the shocking part is really that it took this long for him to give up.  Like, I don't want to sound discouraging -- the dedication and persistence he's shown up until now is genuinely awesome.  After years of waiting already, I never expected A.N.N.E. to come this close.

And it does exist in a playable form; which, given this dev update, is likely to be its <i>final</i> form.  But "the creator still considers it unfinished" is a pretty big caveat to start a game with.
