[Automatron](game:Fallout 4: Automatron) is about robots.  You fight robots, you get a new companion who's a robot, and you build an upgrade station for robots! Robots, robots, robots.

Unfortunately that upgrade station represents a geometric progression of the inventory-management-hell problem I lamented in <game:Fallout 4>.  There are so many damn upgrades, requiring such a crazy variety of salvaged parts and pieces -- the menu is bewildering to look at.  I did like two upgrades and never bothered with it again.

(It doesn't help that I'd already picked my favorite companion by this point in the game, and it wasn't a robot.  The robot upgrade station is effectively pointless if you don't have a robotic companion.)

This DLC also adds a quest-line to hunt down the Mechanist, whose robots have been roaming the Commonwealth and slaughtering its hapless settlers.  You've got the handful of go-here-collect-that-kill-everyone quests that you'd expect, nothing I'd really call special or memorable, up until the final quest that takes you to the Mechanist's Lair -- a <i>gruelingly-long</i> dungeon that I was tired of before the halfway point, capped off with an exhausting wave-based gauntlet of robot fights.

Automatron's content isn't nearly compelling enough to justify how much <i>work</i> is required to enjoy it.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Borderlands 2: Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt>  
<b>And the ending, where the Mechanist is unmasked</b>: what a disappointingly hackneyed twist.
