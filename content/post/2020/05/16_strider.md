The core action gameplay of {{% game "Strider (2014)" %}}Strider (2014){{% /game %}} is mostly solid, but a few fatal flaws make it more frustrating than its vacant story is worth.

First off: this is a bad example of a Metroidvania (more so than {{% game "Headlander" %}}Headlander{{% /game %}} was).  The world map is large and interconnected, but your path through it is almost entirely linear.  Occasions to stray from the beaten path are rare -- there are optional upgrades for e.g. health, but not very many.  Often, the game uses one-way obstacles - sometimes even re-locking an open door! - to <i>prevent</i> you from backtracking and force you toward the current objective.

I'd overlook the strict linearity if those objectives were narratively compelling, but they're nothing more than a series of techno-babble macguffins, serving the transparent purpose of taking you from one end of the map to the other.  The story is <b>bare</b> as if to pay homage to the original NES game: it starts with zero explanation, there are almost no named characters (other than bosses), and even though I'm halfway through the game, I still don't know what the protagonist's motivation is.

Strider clearly doesn't care about storytelling, and wants you to enjoy the action for its own sake.  And while its sword-slicing and -dicing is fun when it works, the game commits more than enough cardinal sins to dull its appeal:

* Checkpoint placement is both infrequent and unclear; death will often result in a surprising amount of re-treading.
* Cutscenes are unskippable, even (especially) the ones that precede boss fights, which you'll have to watch over and over again on every attempt.
* Bosses, and even some regular enemies, have an annoying tendency to effectively <i>trap</i> you with attacks that knock you back then fire again as soon as you're up; or bullet-hell-like attacks that feel like they come out of nowhere.
* And the controls just aren't quite tight enough to satisfy Strider's high-action ambitions.  Specifically, running and ducking are both controlled by the left analog stick, and it's frustratingly easy to <i>accidentally</i> trigger the duck, immediately stopping in place.

Really, this feels like a decades-old no-frills action game with a nice coat of paint and some under-baked features tacked onto it.  On balance, the action is "okay," but the rest of the game is simply not interesting enough to keep me going.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Forma.8" %}}Forma.8{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Gato Roboto" %}}Gato Roboto{{% /game %}}  
<b>And in the "embarrassing technical issue" department</b>: I had to play on my <i>old</i> PC, because my new build has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/235210/discussions/0/1634166237662954679/">too many CPU cores</a>!?

<i>Progress: the "Black Marketer" told me to destroy the "Gravitron" to access the "Temple."</i>
