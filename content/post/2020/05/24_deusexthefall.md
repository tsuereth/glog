<game:Deus Ex: The Fall> is exactly what I would expect from asking a mobile game studio to re-make <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution> in the Unity engine with a minimal budget.

<b>Everything</b> about this game is "cheap."  The animations and models are low-effort.  The camera often clips into the environment.  The UI art is flat and under-detailed.  The writing is poorly-edited schlock, the voice acting is rote and dull.  The inventory controls are a wreck, due to having crammed too many options into a touch-screen interface, <i>and then</i> haphazardly translating them back onto a keyboard.  (Movement controls, at least, <i>mostly</i> work by simply duplicating the control scheme from Human Revolution and [Mankind Divided](game:Deus Ex: Mankind Divided).)

I didn't even get far enough in the game to see its Detroit- or Prague-equivalent hub area, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/258180/discussions/0/540741858706530751/">the internet tells me</a> that I'm not missing much.

The game really set itself up for failure by attempting to imitate the full scope and complexity of a big-budget, high-resolution Deus Ex title.  Not only because some of those mechanics map poorly to a mobile device - the aim-then-shoot control is ... <i>yikes</i> - but more because it was an obviously over-ambitious plan for such an under-funded project.  <a href="https://unity3d.com/showcase/case-stories/nfusion-eidosmontreal-deusex-thefall">This Unity-praising press piece</a>, despite its promotional spin, shows off how many corners the team had to cut to crank this game out quickly and cheaply.

Some of Human Revolution's features should map <i>perfectly</i> to a mobile device, and even those - like the hacking minigame, or reading pocket secretaries - feel like low-rent knock-offs here.

This small-screen spin-off is clunky for a mobile game, and just plain bad for a PC game.  Its resemblance to Human Revolution and Mankind Divided invites some intensely unfortunate comparisons to triple-A productions; The Fall is just like them, but, worse.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Cat Quest>, <game:Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link> (or even <game:Alpha Protocol>)  
<b>As with <game:Just Cause 3></b>: I didn't expect much, but at least it was <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/get-54-square-enix-pc-games-for-under-dollar40-in-this-amazing-steam-charity-bundle">for a good cause</a>.

<i>Progress: Gave up after I fell through the map in the first mission.</i>
