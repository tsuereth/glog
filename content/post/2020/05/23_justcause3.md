"Isn't good enough" is how I [most recently]($SiteBaseURL$2013/06/17/no-just-cause-isnt-a-good-enough-reason/) summarized <game:Just Cause 2>, and I really can't come up with a better overview for <game:Just Cause 3>.

The traversal mechanics are kind-of neat, grapple-pulling and parachuting around; but neutered, in comparison to similar grappling concepts from <game:Batman: Arkham City> or <game:Marvel's Spider-Man> -- due to this game's lack of tall buildings.  Its proclivity for explosiveness is <i>cool</i>, but not as dense, or strategic, as <game:The Saboteur>'s.  The variety of guns is somewhat impressive, but well short of the armory in <game:Red Faction: Guerrilla> (and the controls still aren't responsive or intuitive enough).  The story is flippantly nonsense, but not in the <i>fun</i> way that <tag:Saints Row> embraces so well.

The "point," to me, is demonstrated in its liberation system: blow up all the items of interest in an enemy stronghold, so that the rebels can overtake it.  But some of these items are bizarrely small, effectively hidden; and until you find and destroy them all, enemies will continue swarming the area.  Then, once you've finally destroyed the last widget, a switch immediately flips and the enemies are replaced by allies.  This is a primary - maybe <i>the</i> primary - gameplay loop, yet it plays like a hidden-object game and completing it has no dramatic or satisfying payoff.

Just Cause 3's <b>checklist</b> of content and features is impressive, and its execution has improved since the preceding game, but it still doesn't measure up to its sandbox competitors; even ones that were released 5 or more years earlier.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Just Cause 2>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor>, or any of the other games I name-checked.  
<b>It's not like I expected anything different</b>: but, hey, it's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/get-54-square-enix-pc-games-for-under-dollar40-in-this-amazing-steam-charity-bundle">for charity</a> right?
