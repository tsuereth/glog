After finally limping through <game:Fallout 4> (and especially [Nuka World](game:Fallout 4: Nuka World)), I felt like playing something <i>completely different</i>.  Something with a gripping adventure story, simple mechanics, pleasant visuals, a short running-length; and to be safe, something I'd played before.  My memory of <game:Prince of Persia (2008)> fit that bill perfectly -- but unfortunately, my memory didn't age very well.

[A decade ago]($SiteBaseURL$2008/12/24/prince-of-persia-2008-8/), I was in love with the game's "optional dialog sequences."  Today, they feel more like cutscenes that you need to keep pressing a button for.  Some of the dialog is vitally informative to Prince's and Elika's character building; so why is it optional?  And the rest are throwaway lines that feel like a waste of my button-presses.

<game:Uncharted: Drake's Fortune> was released the year before PoP 2008, and the following ten years of [Uncharted games](tag:Uncharted) more than proved Naughty Dog's concept of <i>mixing</i> banter with parkour in real-time.  If this game was made just a year later, I'm sure they would have done the same; now, the optional cutscenes - which still interrupt gameplay - feel like a big step back.  (And <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636046/">Nolan North</a>'s wry voice acting keeps inviting the comparison.)

The combat is stupid.  I tolerated it back then, and I can barely put up with it today.  Maybe, back in 2008, the movement and ability controls were like a breath of fresh air compared to [Sands of Time](game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (NGC, PC, PS2, PS3, XBOX)) and its sequels; but now, it's really nothing special.  Now, I can't help but focus on the aggravating timing quirks - like when I successfully parry an enemy attack, but then it attacks again immediately, anyway - and how disruptive and time-wasting the "we're at the edge, better turn around!" animations become.  Especially for the Warrior boss, who needs to be corralled to a specific spot and moves ... <i>so</i> ... slowly.

And while, in theory, gathering light seeds via explorational parkour is a highlight of the game; in my replay, I <i>dreaded</i> the backtracking involved in collecting more glowing bits.  Maybe it's a consequence of the environment art no longer holding my interest -- I just didn't look forward to going off in new directions, or finding new obstacles to overcome.  I only wanted to make progress in the story, and the light seed requirements to do so felt like a pretty artificial hurdle.

That story, by the way, isn't compelling on its own.  But this was true back in 2008, too.  And... can you believe that the PC version <i>still</i> doesn't have the <a href="https://princeofpersia.fandom.com/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_Epilogue">Epilogue</a> DLC that picks up after the main game's abrupt, borderline-cliffhanger ending?  (Well, sure, I can believe it.  But I feel like I shouldn't.)

The years haven't been kind to our prince.  I'll admit that I still have a soft spot for the <i>idea</i> of wall-running and jumping through canyons to save ancient kingdoms from evil magic; but in retrospect, it's clear that a lot of this game's appeal was in its newness, and how pretty it looked.  The mechanical sophistication and graphical horsepower of today's games make PoP look relatively sloppy.

I hope that, someday, someone figures out how to properly revive this series.  <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/prince-of-persia-concept-video-appears-and-confirms-why-series-has-been-dormant/">A man can dream...</a>

<b>Better than</b>: <game:RiME>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (NGC, PC, PS2, PS3, XBOX)>, whose storytelling, at least, still holds up.  
<b>Oh hey, remember the demo for</b>: <game:Raji: An Ancient Epic>?  Not holding my breath, but, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5jNnDMfxA">there's a chance</a>!

<i>Progress: Barely more light seeds than were absolutely required.</i>
