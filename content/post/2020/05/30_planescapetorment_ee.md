Back in March, after bouncing off of {{% game "Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition" %}}Baldur's Gate{{% /game %}}, I naturally gave a shot to its close friend {{% game "Planescape: Torment - Enhanced Edition" %}}Planescape: Torment{{% /game %}}.  And I was pleasantly surprised -- while the former showed how far RPGs have come in the past two decades, the latter didn't feel nearly as dated.

Probably because it seems to be using the Infinity Engine as a storytelling vehicle - focusing on dialog and storytelling rather than on antiquated combat mechanics (and corresponding tutorials/ramp-up) - and because the writing quality of said story is actually pretty good!  Torment did a better job of keeping my attention in its opening hour.  But it was still kinda slow-moving, so I got distracted by {{% game "Fallout 4" %}}Fallout 4{{% /game %}} and <i>upgraded my PC</i> and took my sweet time circling back...

Which is how I've now discovered that, while Planescape: Torment EE "supports" Steam Cloud Saves, they're <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/466300/discussions/0/135514151379575129/">turned off by default</a>.  So, my hour of progress is gone forever.

This is just enough discouragement to prevent me from diving back in.  Sure it would only take me an hour to get back to where I was, but if I'm only into it for the story anyway, I may as well read or watch it online.
