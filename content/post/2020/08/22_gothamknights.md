I appreciate that {{% game "Gotham Knights" %}}Gotham Knights{{% /game %}} is being up-front about how it <i>isn't</i> a {{% tag "Batman: Arkham" %}}"Batman" game{{% /tag %}}.  Bruce is gone, Bats isn't even part of the title -- and whether or not Knights incorporates any stealth, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJjRRErYdO4">footage so far</a> is clearly more focused on combat.

{{% game "Batman: Arkham Asylum" %}}Arkham Asylum{{% /game %}} was an excellent Batman simulator, while its follow-ups {{% game "Batman: Arkham City" %}}City{{% /game %}} then {{% game "Batman: Arkham Knight" %}}Knight{{% /game %}} gradually added more open-world superheroism.  I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing if Knights iterates specifically on the latter, especially since this dev studio has some relevant experience from the {{% game "Batman: Arkham Origins" %}}Arkham Origins{{% /game %}} spin-off.

That said, the dialog in the demo trailer... ugh.  I would have hoped <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/">Batman & Robin</a></i> was a low narrative bar to clear, but dramatic banter like "We'll see about that" has me nervous.
