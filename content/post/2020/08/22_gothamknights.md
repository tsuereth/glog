I appreciate that <game:Gotham Knights> is being up-front about how it <i>isn't</i> a ["Batman" game](tag:Batman: Arkham).  Bruce is gone, Bats isn't even part of the title -- and whether or not Knights incorporates any stealth, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJjRRErYdO4">footage so far</a> is clearly more focused on combat.

[Arkham Asylum](game:Batman: Arkham Asylum) was an excellent Batman simulator, while its follow-ups [City](game:Batman: Arkham City) then [Knight](game:Batman: Arkham Knight) gradually added more open-world superheroism.  I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing if Knights iterates specifically on the latter, especially since this dev studio has some relevant experience from the [Arkham Origins](game:Batman: Arkham Origins) spin-off.

That said, the dialog in the demo trailer... ugh.  I would have hoped <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/">Batman & Robin</a></i> was a low narrative bar to clear, but dramatic banter like "We'll see about that" has me nervous.
