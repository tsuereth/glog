Not much to say, here; I tried <game:Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance> again and stopped even sooner than [the last time]($SiteBaseURL$2014/01/12/reeeeeeevengeance/) I played it.

As I was six years ago, I'm annoyed that the game doesn't do a very good job of explaining what it wants me to do.  The difference this time around is that I have less patience to learn how to <s>git gud</s> properly exploit this combat system.  How many die-and-retry loops, how many online references, will it take?  More than I'm up for.

My more-recent attempt at <game:Transformers: Devastation> and replay of <game:Vanquish> have also tempered my expectations of Revengeance -- that is, I'm not looking forward to uncovering the rest of Raiden's story.  Those other titles reinforced that, past a shiny presentation and bombastic-but-shallow narrative, the "point" of a [Platinum](tag:PlatinumGames) game is its combat... and I'm just not that into it.

<i>Progress: Gave up on the Blade Wolf fight in R-01.</i>
