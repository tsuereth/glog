<game:Burn Me Twice> is obviously <i>inspired</i> by <tag:Ace Attorney>, its opening moments showing a judge, in a courtroom, who asks you to present evidence and witness testimony to prove a case.

But it throws this inspiration into a unique setup: witch trials!  And ... you're the witch! but you're also an agent of the inquisition!?  So your crime scene investigations get to use <i>magic</i>, and the game's narrative liberally blends the occult into mundane incidents like <i>murder</i>.

In that sense, Burn Me Twice is much more of <b>its own game</b> than a mere clone like [Regeria Hope](game:Regeria Hope Episode 1).

Unfortunately, it's also not very well-polished: evidence has to be presented in the "right" order, magic investigation hints tend to waste your time, and English dialog could use an additional localization pass.

I really like the idea, though.  A larger budget and more rigorous design could do something really interesting with this.

<i>Progress: Finished the introductory case.</i>
