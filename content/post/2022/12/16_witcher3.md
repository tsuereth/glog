I've been hankering for [Witcher 3](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)'s "next-gen" (now well into current-gen) update since [last year]($SiteBaseURL$2021/12/12/dawn-harder/), so it's somewhat predictable that I had to <i>stop</i> waiting and just toss another coin at the existing Witcher before - literally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cd-projekt-release-witcher-3-next-gen-consoles-dec-14-2022-11-14/">the following week</a> - the update finally got a release date.

Not like I was about to <i>put the controller down</i> and go back to waiting, though.  I was already in <i>too deep</i>.

I had forgotten about the [early-ish-game quest drought]($SiteBaseURL$2018/06/03/lets-play-cards-gwent-wouldnt-be-bad/), after White Orchard but before most of Velen's content is level-appropriate; even Gwent opponents can feel over-powered until Geralt's put in a bit of exploratory grinding.

And I'd also forgotten how clunky the basic controls can feel -- Geralt's turning radius making it an occasional challenge to precisely target lootable objects.

No regrets, though.  Even the un-updated game holds up well, telling an epic, enthralling tale with compelling characters and engaging sidequest content.

(This time around, I tried using internet guidance to ensure I got "the most" out the game - meaning, to avoid missing optional quest cutoffs - but I can't really recommend this approach.  Tracking multi-dimensional storyline completion criteria is more work than it's worth, and felt like a distraction from the game's natural flow of events.)

Has the clunkiness been improved in this month's update?  Is the (very slight) new content worthwhile?  Well, I dunno yet.  It was hard enough saving <i>any</i> quests until after the update finally went live; next stop, [Beauclair](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine).

<i>Progress: Finished all main (and secondary? I think?) quests in the base game and [Hearts of Stone](game:The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone).</i>
