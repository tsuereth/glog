I didn't care much for <game:Evoland> -- looking back... wow I <i>[really disliked]($SiteBaseURL$2014/07/06/rpg-fan-fiction/)</i> Evoland.

<game:Evoland 2> certainly learned one thing from its predecessor, at least in the amount I played: it's more focused on top-down Zelda-like mechanics, and remains mostly consistent with those mechanics as it jumps around to puzzle or stealth or other tangents.

But its sense of humor is still extremely shallow.  Evoland 2's "parodies" don't, uh, evolve beyond simple references to other games: solving a placemat puzzle from [Professor Layton](game:Professor Layton and the Curious Village), using a cardboard box to [hide from guards](tag:Metal Gear), playing <tag:Castlevania> music while fighting bats in a sewer.

It's not clever enough to be funny, and absent that angle, Evoland 2 is a bigger, longer, but still un-original and under-executed adventure game.

It's kinda like a better-made, but less-interesting, <game:Undertale>.  Actually, yeah, that's <i>exactly</i> what this is.

Last time, I cautioned Evoland players to "just stop" when the game became tiresome; this time, I'll take my own advice.

<i>Progress: Completed Genova's chores, still stuck in the past.  (Hah!)</i>
