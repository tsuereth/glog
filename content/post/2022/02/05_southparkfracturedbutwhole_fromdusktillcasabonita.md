If [The Fractured But Whole](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole) was comparable to "some of the show's best multi-episode arcs," then [From Dusk Till Casa Bonita](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - From Dusk Till Casa Bonita) is like a great standalone episode.

It's a fantastic parody premise, adapting the idea of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/">From Dusk Till Dawn</a> to South Park's <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/South_Park_Vampire_Society">vamp kids</a> and the - believe it or not, <i>non-fictional</i> - <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Casa_Bonita_(Location)">Casa Bonita</a> restaurant.  This sets up some pitch-perfect "South Park moments" juxtaposing the dark and supernatural with a food court and a mariachi band.

Especially the final boss, >!where an attempted summoning of vampire Corey Haim from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/">The Lost Boys</a> instead resurrects the cartoon's version of <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Michael_Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> and induces "Thriller" dance moves!<, feels like <i>peak</i> South Park.

As for gameplay, this DLC benefits from keeping itself constrained: it restricts you to one new class (with in-theme abilities), locks down your party (including newcomer <a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Henrietta_Biggle">Henrietta</a>), and uses but doesn't change your fart-time powers.  It strikes a great balance between new and old ideas <i>and</i> streamlines the game's pre-existing sprawl of class and party options.

Its "world," that is, the Casa Bonita restaurant - including an arcade and Black Bart's Cave! - does lack the main game's open-world scale and its abundance of South Park references.  But it does still manage to fit a little non-linearity into this small space, allowing you to collect some vampire relics in whatever order you like.

From Dusk Till Casa Bonita is a short, but functionally-complete slice of gamified South Park.  I'd love to see more self-contained stories like this one.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 3: Leviathan>, <game:South Park: The Stick of Truth> (yeah, the full game!)  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect 3: Citadel>, <game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole>  
<b>Spoiler alert</b>: There's only [one more self-contained story](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - Bring the Crunch) like this one.
