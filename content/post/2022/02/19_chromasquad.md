{{% game "Chroma Squad" %}}Chroma Squad{{% /game %}} is a bit of a paradox.  A good one, though.

The game is unabashedly "indie," with its zoomed-in sprite art, unpolished grammar, overlong pre-battle animations, and spotty or <i>absent</i> tutorials.  <i>But</i>, it takes itself un-seriously enough that these rough edges actually feel charming -- especially when the game's cast pokes fun at their own narrator.  More often than not, Chroma Squad comes across as "in" on the joke - the joke that is the real history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers">Power Rangers</a> - instead of falling into a {{% game "Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn" %}}parody trap{{% /game %}}.

It's filled with mechanics, like, definitely too many mechanics: not just strategy RPG tactics and character progression and TV studio management, but also item crafting! and mecha battles! and a branching narrative!?  The scope of Chroma Squad is so sprawling that <i>of course</i> a lot of it doesn't pan out, and it's hardly surprising that, for example, the crafting UI can't indicate whether an item is an upgrade or a downgrade.  <i>But</i>, the critical path - increasing fanpower, generating income, buying new weapons and armor - works well enough that the rest is, well, easy to ignore.

Its narrative is pretty silly, gleefully blurring the lines between a Super Sentai fantasy and a TV production <i>about</i> that fantasy.  At face value, Chroma Squad's plot is unremarkable, and its "characters" are just farcical props.  <i>But</i>, the fun that they have with sending up <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">genre tropes</a> and with a Deadpool-esque disregard for the fourth wall is surprisingly compelling.

There's a lot going on in Chroma Squad, and even ignoring the parts it doesn't explain, much of it doesn't work very well.  To that point: my biggest obstacle in the final boss battle wasn't the boss, and wasn't his minions, but was <i>stairs</i>.  I don't think any previous encounter <i>had</i> stairs, so their effects on movement and targeting were an unwelcome surprise.

Chroma Squad is an ambitious game, and far from perfect.

<i>But</i>, it nails - or gets close enough to nailing - a core loop of fighting, upgrading, and lampooning that <b>it works</b>.  There are opportunities to improve for sure (which <a href="https://www.beholdstudios.com.br/">the developers</a> sadly seem to be uninterested in), but even in this unrefined form, the concept is proven: managing a fake Super Sentai team is pretty fun.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Massive Chalice" %}}Massive Chalice{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut" %}}Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut{{% /game %}}, {{% game "SteamWorld Heist" %}}SteamWorld Heist{{% /game %}}

<b>And it helps</b>: that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/363800/Chroma_Squad__Soundtrack/">the soundtrack</a> is damn catchy.

<i>Progress: Finished a campaign on "Interesting" difficulty.</i>
