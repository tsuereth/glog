Like [From Dusk Till Casa Bonita](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - From Dusk Till Casa Bonita), the [Bring the Crunch](game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - Bring the Crunch) DLC tells a self-contained South Park story and shows off a handful of new gameplay ideas.

This time, the kids are off to summer camp, and it's haunted - yes, this is a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/">slasher film</a> parody - but the "monsters" you run into are clearly adults in Scooby Doo outfits.  And your new class is the "Final Girl" movie stereotype, using makeshift weapons like garden shears and saw blades to survive.

It doesn't reach the "highs" of its predecessor: the story doesn't evolve much from that promising setup (aside from a bizarre >!alien!< twist near the end), and its new mechanics are hit-and-miss -- laying saw traps is pretty neat, while the "mint" buffs and "berry" debuffs feel ... unnecessary.

But, this is still like an episode of South Park in videogame form, which is pretty good.

It does make some strides in micro-sized open-world design, with a map!, and an optional collectibles quest where you take <i>selfies with ghosts</i>.

This is a perfectly satisfying and fun story DLC, just not quite as good as the other one.  And since it looks like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-next-south-park-game-will-be-3d-and-developed-in-house/">there might not be another</a>, well, it's not a bad send-off for the South Park RPGs.

<b>Better than</b>: the same stuff that From Dusk Till Casa Bonita was better than, <game:Mass Effect 3: Leviathan> and <game:South Park: The Stick of Truth>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:South Park: The Fractured But Whole - From Dusk Till Casa Bonita>  
<b>While the name "<a href="https://southpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lake_Tardicaca">Lake Tardicaca</a>" hasn't aged well</b>: this chapter does treat its differently-abled characters respectfully, so, there's that.
