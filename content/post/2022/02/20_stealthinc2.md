I'm less persistent than I was {{% abslink href="2013/06/20/stealth-maybe-bastard-definitely/" %}}back in 2013{{% /abslink %}} -- that's one reason why I'm not sticking with {{% game "Stealth Inc 2: A Game of Clones" %}}Stealth <s>Bastard</s> Inc 2{{% /game %}}.  I've got less patience for <i>SURPRISE DEATHTRAP!</i> than I once did.

But regardless, I'm ... not sure if this sequel's improvements really "improve" upon {{% game "Stealth Bastard Deluxe" %}}Stealth Bastard Deluxe{{% /game %}}.

* Its 2.5-d presentation makes it difficult to visually parse background flavor vs. foreground obstacles.
* Its additional complexities - clones moving on their own, gadgets adding tactical twists - mesh poorly with time-sensitive <i>SURPRISE DEATHTRAPS</i>.
* And its interconnected "hub" world is more of a fancy menu than a Metroidvania, since each test chamber exists completely separately from the map.

Also, it has cutscenes that try to tell a story, but they really, really don't work.  I'm not sure that I even understand <i>what</i> the plot is, let alone what motivation I'm supposed to derive from it.  Would've been better to just cold-open in a stealth testing facility with no exposition.

<i>Progress: gave up in Area 2.</i>
