These misfits may not look <i>quite</i> like their <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/">big-screen counterparts</a>, and their backstories may diverge from the movies', but make no mistake: <game:Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy> <b>thrives</b> on the same rogueish quips, silly humor, and 1980s rock music that's made the MCU Guardians so compelling.

The game starts with our lovable mercenaries, somewhat predictably, "going around the law" and getting themselves into trouble; and as their reckless decision-making gradually heightens those stakes, the <i>Milano</i> puts in some serious miles taking them to various familiar (and unfamiliar) places and characters.  Their journey is a surprisingly epic one, always managing to pack in some unexpected and wacky detour while still maintaining a coherent overall plot.

Sometimes the story gives you a choice for what Peter Quill says or does, and sometimes an ominous "Rocket will remember that" may appear in the corner, but this is more for comedic value than for role-playing.  And there aren't multiple endings or significant narrative branches here: Guardians focuses itself on a linear thrill-ride of a campaign.

It has some combat, too.

It's not that the party-based fighting action is bad, in fact its combination of mechanics works pretty well!, yelling orders at your AI-operated crew like a <game:Secret of Mana> or a [Tales game](tag:Tales of) while you yourself hover around on Quill's <a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Jet_Boot_Attachments">jet boots</a> taking pot-shots.

But aiming and dodging feels a little more clunky than it should, especially in hectic fights with lots of enemies and flashing effects.  And of your special abilities, and the debuffs your crew can apply, only a few really seem worth using (those with stun effects and high-damage explosions).

It's fine, though - as are your very limited level-up and crafting options - because combat is simple enough to be fun, and rarely a frustration or annoyance.  And more importantly, because your team is yelling at each other the entire time!  The voice-acted back-and-forth, like some spacefaring [Nate and Sully](tag:Uncharted) routine, continuously reinforces the characterizations of the Guardians.

And the "Huddle" mechanic is an utterly transparent way to give you a quick break mid-battle, then replace the soundtrack with a rockin' power ballad.  It's <i>awesome</i>.

Guardians' shooting action <i>could</i> have been more fluid or tactical, and its progression <i>could</i> have been more elaborate, but they didn't really need to be -- the "gameplay" is more than adequate in accompanying, puncuating, and spicing up its protagonists' banter on their crazy, dramatic, hilarious adventure.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Mass Effect 3>, <game:Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Mass Effect 2>, <game:Uncharted 4: A Thief's End>  
<b>Most-wanted addition to the MCU</b>: definitely Cosmo, although this game universe's Mantis is a close second.
