<game:Baba Is You>, with its straightforward way of messaging "the rules" on the game field - but spiraling in complexity as you <i>modify</i> those rules to solve the puzzle - hooked me right away.

That was six months ago.

While Baba does a much better job of constraining state than <game:Recursed> did, and that (plus step-by-step rewinding) makes it easy to gradually stumble through its earlier puzzles... it nevertheless reaches a point where rule combinations and <b>intricate</b> solutions require plotting out a brain-breaking number of steps ahead.

And while Baba is kind enough to provide multiple choices of which puzzle to do next, I got stuck in a spot where <i>all</i> of those choices were making me go cross-eyed.

Taking an extended break, and returning to the game with a totally clear perspective, unfortunately didn't help.  The rules are clear, but these puzzles still confuse the absolute shit out of me.

I really enjoyed figuring out the less-intricate puzzles, though.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Recursed>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Khimera: Puzzle Island>  
<b>I even got stuck with hints</b>: because, honestly, <a href="https://www.keyofw.com/baba-is-hint">these cryptic hints</a> aren't that helpful.

<i>Progress: 62 spores, 4 blossoms.</i>
