<game:Hob> looks nice.

That's the good part: it prioritizes a consistent art style, simple yet evocative environments, and fixed camera views that show off some finely-curated scenes.

And if you're wondering whether that camera direction gets in the way of the game: yeah!  It does.  Sometimes I wondered if the fixed-cameras decision was made late in production, because there were a few moments of foregrounds obscuring the action, or awkwardly running "into" the camera, that simply didn't work.

Hob similarly makes questionable choices in its user interface: like, it may <i>sound</i> cool to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUD_(video_gaming)">heads-up</a> elements small and show more of the game field, but in practice, the UI just <i>doesn't explain</i> shit.  Inventory and map icons are hard to decipher, and all too often, a button prompt omits vital information like whether you're supposed to "press" or "hold" said button.

It even goes so far as <i>omitting objective markers</i> sometimes, though I wonder if those might be bugs, because I'm not the only one (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/404680/discussions/0/1489987634005297260/">exhibit a</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/404680/discussions/0/1621726179565975932/">exhibit b</a>) who just didn't fuckin' know what to do.

The low-detail design spirit carries over into Hob's narrative, which has <i>no script</i>, written or otherwise.  A small cast of NPCs just grunts, and gestures in directions, to attempt to convey information.  I still don't really know what was going on the whole time.

To that point: in the game's <a href="https://www.neoseeker.com/hob-game/walkthrough/End_Game">ending moments</a>, you can make a choice to join - or fight - the final boss.  But that choice isn't ... explained at all, said boss just waves hands and makes noises, and there aren't any input prompts for what you might do.

So I guess I joined the enemy and the game ended.  Whatever.

In theory, Hob is a fascinating [Zelda](tag:The Legend of Zelda)-like with minimal, straightforward mechanics; in practice, its minimalism is more hindrance than help.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas>, <game:RiME>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Cat Quest II>  
<b>Let's say, as good as</b>: <game:AER: Memories of Old>

<i>Progress: got the bad(?) ending.</i>
