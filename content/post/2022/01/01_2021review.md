<i>Alternative title: "2021 in Review: Different Year, Same Bullshit"</i>

... but, {{% abslink href="2021/01/01/2020-in-review-interesting-times/" %}}like 2020{{% /abslink %}}, 2021 had an upside: lots of opportunity to catch up on my videogame backlog.

Not all of that catching-up made it into the Glog -- more and more, I'm rapidly trying and discarding games, without wasting time on write-ups.  (I'll get to the <i>hard data</i> on that later.)

In fact, 2021 saw my {{% abslink href="2021/09/06/dismissable-content/" %}}first multi-game post!{{% /abslink %}}, resulting in <i>more games played than posts written</i> for the first time in Glog history (ooh, ahh).  I consider that a good omen for my future gaming activity: less writing, more playing!

Anyway, my continued focus on backlog-busting also meant I paid less attention than ever to demos (<game:Copy Editor> being the sole exception), although ...

... just as in 2020, I did feel a frequent need to cleanse my palate, by replaying known-good games.

Setting aside <game:Darksiders II> and [Deadly Premonition](game:Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut) - which <i>were</i> in my backlog to re-attempt, and which I've now finally abandoned - that Replay count consists of some really satisfying "comfort food" remasters:

* <game:Mass Effect Legendary Edition>, despite the [first game](game:Mass Effect)'s awkward start, reunited me with truly endearing space-scoundrels in its [second](game:Mass Effect 2) and [third](game:Mass Effect 3) chapters.
* <game:Saints Row: The Third Remastered> was a great excuse to re-wreak havoc in Steelport, even though its DLCs ([Genkibowl VII](game:Saints Row: The Third - Genkibowl VII), [Gangstas in Space](game:Saints Row: The Third - Gangstas in Space), [The Trouble with Clones](game:Saints Row: The Third - The Trouble with Clones)) overstayed their welcome a bit.
* And although I'll never be able to re-experience the astonishment of its narrative reveals, <game:Horizon Zero Dawn> and [The Frozen Wilds](game:Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds) were nevertheless <i>wonderful</i> to play through again on PC.

Coincidentally, one side-effect of replaying those particular games (Mass Effect 2, especially) was the <b>most DLCs and expansions I've played in one year</b>:

I've already mentioned Saints Row 3's DLCs, and Horizon's Frozen Wilds; then there were Mass Effect's [Bring Down the Sky](game:Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky), and Mass Effect 2's [Zaeed - The Price of Revenge](game:Mass Effect 2: Zaeed - The Price of Revenge), [Kasumi - Stolen Memory](game:Mass Effect 2: Kasumi - Stolen Memory), [Firewalker Pack](game:Mass Effect 2: Firewalker Pack), [Overlord](game:Mass Effect 2: Overlord), [Lair of the Shadow Broker](game:Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker), and [Arrival](game:Mass Effect 2: Arrival) (phew!) ... which were all pretty underwhelming, and never struck me as critical to the overall Mass Effect epic.

So it was a pleasant surprise that Mass Effect 3's [From Ashes](game:Mass Effect 3: From Ashes), [Omega](game:Mass Effect 3: Omega), [Leviathan](game:Mass Effect 3: Leviathan), and [Citadel](game:Mass Effect 3: Citadel) felt so substantial and rewarding.  Citadel, especially, was a stupendously heartwarming send-off for Shepard and her eclectic gang of misfits.

<game:Borderlands 3>'s DLCs, meanwhile, didn't fare that well; [Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot](game:Borderlands 3: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot) was a fresh little side-adventure, and [Guns, Love and Tentacles](game:Borderlands 3: Guns, Love and Tentacles - The Marriage of Wainwright & Hammerlock) spun a fun yarn as well, but [Bounty of Blood](game:Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood - A Fistful of Redemption) and [Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck](game:Borderlands 3: Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck) didn't bring much new or interesting to the table.  And the so-called [Director's Cut](game:Borderlands 3: Director's Cut) was simply <i>not</i> worth the price of Season Pass 2.

Finally, <game:The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna> may have failed to measure up to its main game's "wow" factor, but it was certainly a clever and worthwhile experience all its own.

As for my gaming platforms in 2021, well, "platform" would be more appropriate; as ever, the overwhelming majority of my playtime was on <platform:PC>.  My singular <i>non</i>-PC playthrough last year was <game:Ghost of Tsushima> on <platform:PS4>.

Which might be my last PS4 game, depending on how the upcoming [God of War](game:God of War Ragnar√∂k) and [Horizon](game:Horizon Forbidden West) sequels perform on the now-"old" hardware.

But if this is the end for my PS4, then it's going out with a "bang," as Ghost of Tsushima ranks among the small number of <rating:Awesome> games I played in 2021.

That ranking also includes:

* <game:The Talos Principle>, which had been sitting in my backlog for <i>seven years!</i>
* Two nonogram-style puzzle games, <game:Piczle Cross Adventure> (which is also an adventure!) and <game:Voxelgram> (which also has a third dimension!)
* And my aforementioned replays of <game:Horizon Zero Dawn> and <game:Mass Effect 2> (which was even better the second time around!)

So - also like 2020 - it's a little disappointing that my top-rated games last year were so principally "puzzle" or "something I've played before."

But, I'd be remiss if I ignored some of the <rating:Good> games I played in 2021, too, like those Mass Effect 3 DLCs; a much-needed <tag:Ace Attorney> installment from <game:The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures> and [Resolve](game:The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve); the enchanting world-building of <game:Shadowrun Returns>, [Dragonfall](game:Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut), and [Hong Kong](game:Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition); and ...

What <i>had</i> been one of the oldest games on my backlog, <game:Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines>, turned out to have aged surprisingly well.  (Granted, it did need some <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patch">modern tech support</a>.)  Bloodlines was a satisfying reminder of <i>why</i> I keep a backlog: sometimes, a game I've missed is actually worth catching up on, and lets me experience something cool that I haven't seen before.

Of course there's still plenty of <i>chaff</i> in my backlog that isn't so worthwhile ... and I did better, in 2021, at not wasting so much time writing about that chaff.  Check that "hard data" above: a marked decline in No Rating posts.  If the game isn't remarkable, then why bother remarking on it?

Hopefully, as I continue burning through my backlog in 2022, I'll stumble across more of those praise-worthy missed gems (and will avoid sinking time into the rest).  Here's to some positive progress - in my backlog, if nothing else - this year!
