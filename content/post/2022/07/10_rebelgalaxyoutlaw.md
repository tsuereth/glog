I didn't play enough of <game:Rebel Galaxy Outlaw> to give it a fair shake; just enough to recognize what I miss - or to realize what I don't miss - from space-life simulators like <tag:Escape Velocity>.

Something I miss: "safe" progression options, or to put it another way, options to create my own stepping-stones toward a fully decked-out warship.  Modern games in this vein do consistently <i>include</i> features like asteroid mining, commodity trading, and simple transport missions, but as I lamented in [the first Rebel Galaxy](game:Rebel Galaxy), they tend to be very ornamental and not worth the time.  (Outlaw has at least some of these, but they're so poorly tutorialized that I don't think the game even wants me to do them.)

Something I don't miss: destinations, like planets and space stations, that are really just text menus.  <game:3030 Deathwar Redux> did a great job of building the illusion that you were actually walking around a spaceport using computer terminals and chatting with NPCs; I wish more genre revivals would take that hint instead of copying the same menu UIs from 20+ years ago.  (Outlaw has 3D renderings of your character interactions, and even some voice acting, but you still click through menus - and submenus! - to initiate actions, so the facade is entirely transparent.)

Something I miss: a bit of substance to space travel.  Pointing at a nav marker and waiting for time to pass is no fun (yo, <game:Starpoint Gemini 2>), but neither is fast-traveling straight to your objective.  Between sublight piloting inside a system, and hyperspeed navigation across systems, one or the other should have enough mechanical complexity to make star-hopping feel <i>earned</i>.  (Outlaw lacks complexity in either, with automatic docking and one-button autopilot jumps.)

Something I don't miss: impenetrable ship combat.  As with navigation, "some" complexity in targeting or maneuvering can be thrilling, but if a game can't pull off [Strike Suit Zero](game:Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut) I'd rather it keep things simple like the original Rebel Galaxy.  Clunky aiming and firing (like <game:Space Pirates and Zombies>), or a proliferation of fiddly energy options <i>a'la</i> "redirect weapons power to shields" (like Outlaw), can make dogfights feel more like <i>work</i> than a game.  (Outlaw does implement a great "follow target" simplification, but throttle-control and evasion are terribly unwieldy.)

And something I <i>kind of</i> miss: compelling storytelling.  I know the old games' mission narratives were just walls of text, and that doesn't cut it anymore, but you can't just whip up some 3D character models and lip-synced voice acting and call it a day.  Without interesting characters or engaging events, <i>why</i> should I upgrade my ship or explore the galaxy?  (Outlaw starts with a wordless animated short that feels like a concept pitch for investors; then the main character's voice-overs sound genuinely uninterested in her own plot.)

I think I'd be kidding myself to believe that substantive, well-written, and well-acted story content could come from anything short of a AAA budget; and even epics like <tag:Mass Effect> miss those marks pretty regularly.  But I do want to believe there's some satisfying compromise, some way for a small, independent production to deliver a good story - and a few fascinating side-stories - in an open galaxy with fun (if simple) mechanics.  Like a sane version of <game:Star Citizen>.
