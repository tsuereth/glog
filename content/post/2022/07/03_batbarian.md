With a grid-based map, save-point safe rooms, hidden treasure chests, button-mashy combat, level-ups... I really thought that [Batbarian's demo]($SiteBaseURL$2020/03/21/cave-vania/) was teasing a full-blown [Bloodstained](game:Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night)-style Igavania.  But after soaking in the full game - now en-subtitled <game:Batbarian: Testament of the Primordials> - for a couple hours, I've come to realize that it's really more of a platforming beat-em-up adventure that's <i>borrowed</i> a 'vania framework.

That is, instead of rapidly accruing new equipment and upgrades that unlock new map areas or overpower enemies, I'm really just solving mildly-puzzling navigation and combat challenges by feeding specialized berries to a magic bat.

That it's more of an action and platforming game than I expected isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I still appreciate the game's humorous dialog...

... but without an abundance of <tag:Metroid>-ey upgrades, or the mechanical complexity that can make a [puzzle-vania](game:Toki Tori 2+), I'm just not that interested.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Chasm>, <game:Pocket Kingdom>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Iconoclasts>, <game:Timespinner>  
<b>Narratively better, but playing it feels more tedious, than</b>: <game:Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight>
