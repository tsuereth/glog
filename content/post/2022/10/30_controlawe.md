"AWE" is <game:Control>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">TLA</a> for Altered World Event, but in <game:Control: AWE>, it might just mean <game:Alan Wake> Expansion.

That's my gripe with this expansion: it's not only tied into Alan Wake's story, its cutscenes are in Alan Wake's storytelling <i>style</i>.  The author-narrating-himself, verbose-stream-of-consciousness style that [I didn't care for](%site.BaseURL%2013/05/16/in-which-the-writer-writes-a-story-about-a-writer-writing-a-story-about-the-writer/) in that game.

Otherwise, it's the same Control stuff - weird environments, creepy conspiracies, paranormal combat action, that stuff - I'd already fallen in love with.  And like [The Foundation](game:Control: The Foundation), this expansion has a satisfying amount of that content to play around in.

It doesn't have as much distinctive gameplay as The Foundation did, though; just some light-based puzzles and puzzle-boss-battles that, while <i>neat</i>, could get a little frustrating (what with unpredictable shadow-monster super-attacks).

... but, despite AWE's fixation on <i>some other game</i>, it's still a fulfilling and fun experience for anyone wanting more Control.

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart>, <game:Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Control: The Foundation>  
<b>If the next Alan Wake includes more Control lore</b>: I might actually muster up some interest for it.

<i>Progress: Finished all the main and side missions.</i>
