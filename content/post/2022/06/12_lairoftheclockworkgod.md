I <i>loved</i> the comedy writing in both <game:Ben There, Dan That!> and <game:Time Gentlemen, Please!>, but the latter's <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">adventure game logic</a> more than wore out its welcome.  So I was excited about <game:Lair of the Clockwork God> <i>because</i> of its new gameplay formula, foregoing points and clicks in favor of runs and jumps.

Except... it doesn't.  In truth, Clockwork God is <b>still an adventure game</b> with counterintuitive puzzles and laborious traversal -- it just <i>also</i> has pressure-plates and block-pushing as part of those puzzles.  (And <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1060600/discussions/0/3111395113763947812/">physics bugs</a>, naturally.)

It's a shame, because the writing is still, just, incredibly charming; especially when it's mocking the games that inspired it, which is <i>often</i>.  But if I need to look up puzzle solutions every 30 seconds - like Use Battery Acid to Melt Vines, or Push Airplane Propeller to Cut Down Tree - I'd rather not play it at all.
