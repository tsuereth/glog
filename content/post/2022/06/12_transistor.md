<i>- Me, [c. 2014]($SiteBaseURL$2014/05/17/keeping-my-eyes-peeled-for-bruce-boxleitner/)</i>

... well, anyway.

<game:Transistor> definitely succeeds at mixing [Supergiant](tag:Supergiant Games)'s colorful style with a techno-mystical TRON motif.  And its blend of real-time and turn-based combat mechanics, though jarring at first, feels unique and exciting.

Unfortunately the narrative takes a hit from ... <i>the narrator</i>: while his character is better-integrated with the game than in <game:Bastion>, he talks so much - and there are so few other voice actors - that eventually the exposition <i>sounds</i> samey and repetitive.

And the gameplay is let down by an intimidating volume of progression options: being able to use every Function as an ability <i>or</i> an ability upgrade <i>or</i> a passive upgrade is a "cool idea," but the resulting matrix of choices is overwhelming, and wasteful.  (After finding a setup that worked for me, I wasn't compelled to experiment any more.)

And -- both the story and the mechanics are limited by Transistor's short running length: 3-4 hours of content leaves a lot of unexplained backstory, and doesn't give that spread of Function options much room to breathe.

I guess the game might be expecting me to "recurse" and run it again - adding Limiters for extra challenge - but that's really not my thing.

I enjoyed my (brief) time with Transistor, to be clear; it just doesn't feel like it lives up to the potential of its ideas.  And in retrospect, seems less like a setup for a TRON-like epic than it does a proof-of-concept for [Hades](game:Hades (2020)).

<b>Better than</b>: <game:Bastion>, <game:Tron: Evolution (PC, PS3, X360)>  
<b>Not as good as</b>: <game:Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut>  
<b>Maybe the best "inside the computer" game so far</b>: But that competition isn't very stiff.  Certainly way better than the hacking minigame in <game:Fallout 4: Far Harbor>.
