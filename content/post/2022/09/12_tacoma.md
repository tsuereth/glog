There's only a <i>little</i> bit of <b>time looping</b> in {{% game "Tacoma" %}}Tacoma{{% /game %}}.  But it's still weird how I keep running into it.

Anyway!  Tacoma, from the makers of {{% game "Gone Home" %}}Gone Home{{% /game %}}, is more than "just another walking simulator."  Sure, it's a first-person narrative exploration game, and sure, the main story beats are in a forced linear sequence; but Tacoma uses self-directed interactive elements to fill the space between those beats, and rewards your curiosity with additional background and scene-setting.

Its core mechanic, replaying recordings of a space station crew's movements and dialog - and learning what happened by following and snooping on them - is really great at immersing you in the game's world.  It's actually surprising how much <i>walking behind a 3D recording</i> pulls you in, as a means of both revealing the plot and illustrating the crew's characters.

(Tacoma also has a subtle, but elegantly-done, "puzzle" mechanic of cracking keypad codes by ... well, I won't give it away.)

It's not a surprise that Tacoma's story is well-written and well-acted, but it is impressive how poignant that story feels in today's pre-cyberpunk (or... early-cyberpunk?) landscape.  The {{% spoiler %}}greedy corporations treating workers like garbage{{% /spoiler %}} trope may be well-worn, but, Tacoma does the hell out of it.

Despite being a brief experience (2-3 hours), one could argue that Tacoma's real-time events and interactivity elevate it beyond a mere "walking simulator."  I, for example, would argue that.

<b>Better than</b>: {{% game "Analogue: A Hate Story" %}}Analogue: A Hate Story{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Gone Home" %}}Gone Home{{% /game %}}  
<b>Not as good as</b>: {{% game "Elsinore" %}}Elsinore{{% /game %}}, {{% game "Outer Wilds" %}}Outer Wilds{{% /game %}}
