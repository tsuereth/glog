Game design question.

Your player is stuck in a time loop; their goal is to break the loop.  Until then, they can use a loadout-menu option to save items from one loop to the next.

Eventually, when the player breaks the loop and sees the end of your story, do you:

<ol type="A">
<li>Skip the loadout menu and its option to save items, because narratively, the loop is broken; or</li>
<li>Still allow the player to save items, because it's a video game, and they might play it again.</li>
</ol>

The correct answer is B.  (Or even better, C: allow players to manage items <i>during regular gameplay</i> so this doesn't need to be a separate step.)

{{% game "DEATHLOOP" %}}DEATHLOOP{{% /game %}} chose A, and -- it's not like I'm heartbroken that several new "Double Trinkets" and a <a href="https://deathloop.fandom.com/wiki/HALPS_Prototype">frickin' laser beam</a> vanished after I watched the <a href="https://deathloop.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Updates/04">Goldenloop update</a>'s extended ending.

I just think it's funny that one of the update's highlight features (the ending) was responsible for me <i>losing</i> its other additions.

That extended ending, by the way, is just a nice-looking cutscene that complements the existing "break the loop" conclusion.  Nothing new or surprising here.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfOYRs4yS78">Cool to watch, though</a>.
